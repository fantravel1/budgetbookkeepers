For example, a $10,000 laptop with a 5-year useful life would be depreciated at $2,000 per year. This creates a tax deduction each year, matches cost to the revenue the equipment helps generate, and reflects the reality that equipment loses value over time."

Calculate your profit margin by dividing net profit by revenue. Track this ratio monthly to spot trends. A declining profit margin over time is a red flag that something is becoming less efficient."

Good year-round bookkeeping makes tax season straightforward."

              Bookkeeping is the day-to-day recording of financial transactions including income, expenses, invoices, and bank reconciliation. Tax preparation is the annual process of filing tax returns using bookkeeping records. Many bookkeepers offer both services, but they are distinct specializations. Good bookkeeping makes tax preparation dramatically easier and cheaper.

              Consider your business stage, monthly transaction volume, industry-specific needs, preferred software (QuickBooks, Xero, FreshBooks, etc.), budget range, and whether you need remote or local support.
