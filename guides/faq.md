## Getting Started

### Q1: When should I start tracking my finances?
**A:** Day 1 of your business. Even before your first sale, you're spending money (equipment, setup costs, marketing). These startup costs matter for tax purposes and understanding your investment. Start with a simple spreadsheet or software and build from there.

### Q2: Do I need a separate business bank account?
**A:** Absolutely. Mixing personal and business money is the #1 bookkeeping mistake. It makes taxes harder, looks unprofessional to customers, and creates legal liability. Open one immediately—it costs $0-15/month.

### Q3: What's the best bookkeeping software for beginners?
**A:**
- **Wave**: Free, good for basics (invoicing, expense tracking)
- **Xero**: $11-50/month, excellent interface, international support
- **QuickBooks Online**: $10-50/month, very powerful
- **FreshBooks**: $15-55/month, invoice-focused

Start with Wave if free is essential. Upgrade to Xero or QB as you grow.

### Q4: Can I do my own bookkeeping or should I hire someone?
**A:** Both are valid:
- **DIY**: Good if you spend <5 hours/week, enjoy it, have simple business
- **Hire professional**: Better if you'd rather focus on business growth (saves 10+ hours/week), have employees, or have complex finances

Cost of hiring ($200-500/month) usually pays for itself through tax savings and time freed up.

### Q5: How often should I do bookkeeping?
**A:**
- **Minimum**: Monthly (reconcile accounts, review statements)
- **Better**: Weekly (record transactions, check for errors)
- **Best**: Daily (record as transactions happen, stay current)

Weekly is sweet spot for most small businesses.

### Q6: What records do I need to keep?
**A:** Keep for 3-7 years (varies by country):
- All receipts
- Invoices (sent and received)
- Bank statements
- Credit card statements
- Payroll records
- Tax documents
- Contracts

Digital backup is essential (cloud storage, not just computer).

### Q7: Do I need to charge sales tax/VAT?
**A:** Depends on:
- Your country
- Your location (state/province)
- Your business type
- Your revenue level

Example: In US, most states require sales tax. In UK, must register for VAT if over £85,000. Check your specific location.

### Q8: What's the difference between gross and net income?
**A:**
- **Gross**: Total money before expenses
- **Net**: Money after expenses (your actual profit)

If you earn $100k but spend $70k, gross is $100k, net is $30k.

### Q9: How do I track multiple income streams?
**A:** Create separate income categories in your chart of accounts:
- Service A Revenue
- Service B Revenue
- Product Revenue
- Affiliate Revenue
- Etc.

This shows which income streams are most profitable.

### Q10: Should I use accrual or cash accounting?
**A:**
- **Cash**: Simpler, good for very small businesses, only record when money arrives
- **Accrual**: More accurate, required for businesses over $100k/year, record when earned

Start with cash, upgrade to accrual as you grow.

### Q11: How do I handle customer deposits/advance payments?
**A:**
- Don't record as income immediately
- Record as "Customer Deposit" (liability) until work is complete
- When work is done, move from liability to income

This is correct accounting and protects you if customer cancels.

### Q12: What if I made mistakes in past bookkeeping?
**A:** Don't panic:
1. Identify the errors (reconcile with bank)
2. Make correcting journal entries (not erasing—always leave audit trail)
3. Document why the change was made
4. Catch up to current date
5. Work with accountant if significant

It's fixable, just requires time to correct properly.

### Q13: Do I need to track time if I'm paid by project, not hourly?
**A:**
- **For taxes**: No legal requirement
- **For business insight**: Yes! Track time per project to calculate real hourly rate. You might find some "projects" pay $20/hour while others pay $100/hour.
- **For clients**: Maybe—helps you estimate future projects accurately

### Q14: How do I handle personal loans to my business?
**A:**
- Document the loan (date, amount, terms)
- Record as loan, not personal investment
- Pay yourself back with interest (at least market rate)
- Don't just take the money and forget it

Treating it properly keeps business finances clean and protects you tax-wise.

### Q15: What happens if I don't do bookkeeping?
**A:**
- Huge stress at tax time (scrambling to find receipts)
- Overpay taxes (can't deduct expenses you haven't recorded)
- Make bad business decisions (don't know which services are profitable)
- Audit risk (can't prove your numbers)
- Get denied for loans (banks need clean books)
- Lose money without knowing where it goes

It costs far more to fix later than to maintain now.

## Bookkeeping Basics

### Q16: What's a chart of accounts and how do I create one?
**A:** It's your category list for income and expenses.

**Income Categories**:
- Service Revenue
- Product Revenue
- Affiliate Revenue

**Expense Categories**:
- Software
- Office Supplies
- Marketing
- Travel
- Meals & Entertainment
- Equipment

**Rule**: Use 8-15 categories (not too many). Refine as you grow.

### Q17: How do I record a transaction?
**A:** Minimum information:
- Date
- Description (who, what)
- Amount
- Category
- Receipt (attach digital photo)

In software: Date → Description → Amount → Category → Save. Takes 30 seconds per transaction.

### Q18: What's the difference between an expense and a purchase?
**A:**
- **Expense**: Money gone forever (supplies, software, meals—reduce profit)
- **Purchase**: Asset you own (equipment, inventory—stays on balance sheet, depreciates)

Example: $50 office supplies = expense. $2,000 laptop = asset (expense it over years).

### Q19: How do I handle cash payments?
**A:**
- Keep receipt (even small ones)
- Record date, amount, category
- Store receipts in envelope/folder
- Enter into software weekly

Tip: Take phone photo of receipt immediately so you don't lose it.

### Q20: What if I can't find a receipt?
**A:**
- Recreate from credit card statement (date, amount, vendor)
- Note "per credit card statement" in description
- If still unsure, don't claim deduction (audit risk)
- Better to miss one deduction than claim something you can't prove

Keep receipts. Photography receipts immediately prevents this problem.

### Q21: How do I categorize meals & entertainment?
**A:**
- **Deductible**: Business meal with client, team lunch, conference meals
- **Not deductible**: Your solo lunch, meal at home
- **Usually 50% deductible**: Meals with business purpose

Document: Who, when, business purpose. "Lunch with client Sarah to discuss project" = good.

### Q22: What counts as home office?
**A:**
- Must be used "regularly and exclusively" for business
- Can't be bedroom you also sleep in
- Can be spare room, part of garage, corner of apartment
- Must be dedicated space

Once claimed, be careful when selling house (potential capital gains tax).

### Q23: How do I calculate home office deduction?
**A:** Two methods:

**Simplified** (easier):
- $5/sq ft per month
- 300 sq ft = $1,500/year deduction

**Actual** (better if high expenses):
- Percentage of home used for office
- Deduct that % of: utilities, insurance, rent/mortgage interest, repairs
- Example: 25% home office = 25% of $20k home expenses = $5,000 deduction

Choose whichever is larger.

### Q24: How do I handle vehicle mileage?
**A:** Two methods:

**Standard Mileage** (easier):
- Track miles driven for business
- Deduct at IRS rate (varies yearly, ~$0.67/mile in 2024)
- Record: date, miles, purpose

**Actual Expense**:
- Deduct actual gas, maintenance, insurance, depreciation
- Only deduct business % of driving
- Better if you drive expensive car or many miles

Choose whichever is larger. Keep mileage log.

### Q25: Can I deduct meals while traveling for business?
**A:** Usually yes, often at 50% rate:
- Meals while traveling for business: Often 100% deductible
- Client meals while traveling: 50% deductible
- Hotel stay itself: 100% deductible

Keep receipts and document business purpose.

### Q26: How do I track inventory?
**A:**
- Beginning inventory + Purchases - Ending inventory = Cost of Goods Sold
- At year-end, count all inventory
- Calculate value (at cost, not sale price)
- Use in profit calculation

Example: Started with $1,000 inventory, bought $5,000, ended with $1,500 = $4,500 COGS.

### Q27: Should I track inventory if I'm dropshipping?
**A:**
- No physical inventory to track
- Record supplier costs when customer purchases
- Much simpler than traditional inventory

This is a major advantage of dropshipping.

### Q28: How do I record vendor payments?
**A:**
- When you pay: Record as expense in appropriate category
- Attach invoice/receipt
- Note vendor name and what was paid for
- In software, mark as paid

If you're tracking aging/payables: Keep list of unpaid invoices separately.

### Q29: How do I handle refunds?
**A:**
- Customer refund: Reduce income (negative income entry)
- Vendor refund: Reduce expense (negative expense entry)
- Document reason (customer requested, defective product, etc)

Example: Refund $50 sale → -$50 income entry

### Q30: What's a transaction reconciliation and why does it matter?
**A:** Matching your records to bank statement:
- Bank says $5,000 deposits this month
- Your records say $5,000 income
- ✅ They match = accurate

Does NOT match? Find the problem:
- Recording error? Fix it
- Timing (check not cleared)? Wait and recheck
- Missing transaction? Add it

Do this monthly. Takes 30-60 minutes.

### Q31: What's an outstanding check?
**A:** Check you wrote but hasn't cleared yet.
- Example: Wrote check on Dec 28, cleared Jan 5
- In reconciliation: Show as "outstanding" in December (not cleared yet)
- Fixed in January (now cleared)

Software handles this automatically.

### Q32: How do I handle credit card expenses?
**A:**
- Don't record when you charge (wait)
- Record when you pay the bill (amount paid, categorize by actual expenses)
- Or record when charged (requires tracking what's paid later)

Most small businesses: Wait and record when paying bill.

### Q33: Should I separate business and personal credit cards?
**A:** Absolutely. Business credit card only for business expenses:
- Easier to categorize
- Clearer bookkeeping
- Better for your business credit

Many small business cards offer cash back or points.

### Q34: How do I handle a transaction I'm unsure about?
**A:**
- Create "Other" or "Miscellaneous" category
- Record the transaction there
- Follow up (ask vendor, check invoice)
- Recategorize once confirmed

Don't just guess. Bad categorization breaks your reporting.

### Q35: What if my categories don't perfectly fit my expenses?
**A:** Create subcategories:

**Marketing**
- Advertising
- Social Media
- Content Creation

This gives you insight into where marketing money actually goes.

## Accounting & Financial Statements

### Q36: What's a profit & loss statement and how do I read it?
**A:**
```
Revenue (all income):              $100,000
Minus: Expenses (all costs):       -$40,000
_________________________________
= Net Profit (bottom line):        $60,000
```

**Rule of thumb**: 20-60% profit is healthy depending on industry.

### Q37: What's on a balance sheet?
**A:** Snapshot of what you own and owe:

**Assets** (what you own):
- Cash: $10,000
- Equipment: $5,000
- Total: $15,000

**Liabilities** (what you owe):
- Loan: $5,000

**Equity** (your stake):
- $15,000 - $5,000 = $10,000

The equation always balances.

### Q38: What's a cash flow statement?
**A:** Where did your cash actually go? Different from profit.

**Example**:
- Profit this month: $10,000
- Cash balance: $12,000
- Why different? Customer owes you $8,000 (earned but not received yet)

Profit ≠ Cash. Both matter.

### Q39: How often should I create financial statements?
**A:**
- **Minimum**: Monthly (for business management)
- **For taxes**: Annually (year-end)
- **For loans**: Quarterly or annually (depending on lender)
- **Best practice**: Monthly review

### Q40: What's depreciation and why does it matter?
**A:** Equipment loses value over time. Accounting spreads the cost.

**Example**: $10,000 laptop over 5 years:
- Annual depreciation: $10,000 ÷ 5 = $2,000/year
- This is an expense, reducing taxes
- After 5 years: $0 book value (but laptop still works)

Tax deduction without cash outflow!

### Q41: When should I depreciate vs. fully deduct equipment?
**A:** Varies by country and item type:
- **Under threshold** ($2,500): Usually fully deduct year 1
- **Over threshold**: Depreciate over years (3-7 years typical)

Check your country's rules. Threshold varies.

### Q42: What's an accumulated depreciation account?
**A:** Shows total depreciation taken.

**Example**:
- Equipment cost: $10,000
- Year 1 depreciation: -$2,000
- Accumulated depreciation: -$2,000
- Net book value: $8,000

Tracked separately for accounting accuracy.

### Q43: How do I calculate profit margin?
**A:**
```
Profit Margin = Net Profit ÷ Revenue

Example:
$30,000 profit ÷ $100,000 revenue = 30% margin
```

**Interpretation**: Keep $0.30 of every dollar.

**Benchmarks**:
- Tech startups: 20-50%
- Retail: 5-15%
- Services: 20-40%
- Consulting: 40-60%

### Q44: What's the difference between margin and markup?
**A:** Common confusion:

**Markup** (on cost):
- Cost: $100
- Markup: 50%
- Price: $150

**Margin** (of sale):
- Price: $150
- Margin: 33% ($50 profit ÷ $150 sale)

50% markup ≠ 50% margin!

### Q45: What's accounts receivable and why track it?
**A:** Money customers owe you.

**Example**:
- Invoice customer Monday: $5,000
- Customer pays Friday: $5,000
- Mon-Fri: This is "accounts receivable"
- Friday: Becomes cash

Track this to know:
- Total receivables (how much cash is coming)
- Age (how overdue are unpaid invoices?)
- Trends (are customers paying slower?)

### Q46: What's accounts payable and why track it?
**A:** Money you owe suppliers.

**Example**:
- Receive invoice Monday: Owe $2,000
- Pay Friday: Cash out $2,000
- Mon-Fri: This is "accounts payable"

Track this to know:
- Total obligations
- When payments are due
- Cash needs

### Q47: What's the current ratio and why does it matter?
**A:**
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities

Example:
$30,000 (cash + receivables) ÷ $15,000 (short-term debt) = 2.0
```

**Interpretation**: You have $2 in assets for every $1 owed short-term.

**Benchmark**: 1.5-3.0 is healthy.

### Q48: What's the debt-to-equity ratio?
**A:**
```
Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt ÷ Owner's Equity

Example:
$50,000 debt ÷ $100,000 equity = 0.5
```

**Interpretation**: For every $1 you own, you've borrowed $0.50.

**Benchmark**: Under 1.0 is conservative. Under 2.0 is reasonable.

### Q49: How do I know if my business is actually profitable?
**A:** Create profit & loss statement:

**Month 1**: Revenue $5,000 - Expenses $3,000 = Profit $2,000 ✓
**Month 2**: Revenue $8,000 - Expenses $4,000 = Profit $4,000 ✓
**Year 1**: Revenue $100,000 - Expenses $60,000 = Profit $40,000 ✓

If net profit is positive, you're profitable.

### Q50: What's a break-even point?
**A:** Revenue where profit = 0 (no loss, no gain).

**Formula**: Fixed Costs ÷ Profit Margin

**Example**:
- Monthly costs: $2,000
- Profit margin on services: 60%
- Break-even: $2,000 ÷ 60% = $3,333 revenue needed

At $3,333 revenue, you break even. Above that, you profit.

### Q51: What's working capital?
**A:** Cash needed to run business day-to-day.

**Calculation**:
- Days to collect from customers: 30
- Days to pay suppliers: 15
- Gap: 15 days
- If monthly costs are $5,000: Need $2,500 working capital

Growth requires MORE working capital (customer deposits help!).

### Q52: How do I project next month's profit?
**A:**
1. Estimate revenue (based on sales pipeline)
2. Estimate expenses (fixed + variable)
3. Profit = Revenue - Expenses

**Example**:
- 3 projects lined up: $15,000
- Normal costs: $5,000
- Projected profit: $10,000

Review actual vs. projected monthly.

### Q53: What's cash flow vs. profit again (importance)?
**A:** You can be profitable but run out of cash!

**Example**:
- Month 1: Invoice $20,000 (profit $15,000), but customer pays in 30 days
- Month 1: Cash balance: $500
- Problem: Can't pay $10,000 rent due in 5 days

Solution: Get deposits, negotiate faster payment, or establish line of credit.

### Q54: How do I improve cash flow?
**A:**
1. Get deposits upfront (30-50% before work)
2. Invoice immediately when work is done
3. Follow up on overdue invoices
4. Negotiate longer payment terms with suppliers
5. Reduce inventory (if applicable)
6. Keep emergency fund for gap periods

### Q55: Should I hire an accountant if I have good bookkeeping?
**A:**
- Good bookkeeping ≠ tax planning
- Accountant can identify tax savings
- Usually pays for itself ($300-1,000 cost, $2,000-10,000 savings)
- Required for complex situations (multiple entities, employees, investments)

---

## Taxes & Deductions

### Q56: What's the difference between tax deduction and tax credit?
**A:**
- **Deduction**: Reduces taxable income (example: $5,000 deduction × 25% tax = $1,250 savings)
- **Credit**: Direct reduction in tax owed ($1,000 credit = $1,000 savings)

Credits are always better!

### Q58: Can I deduct my home internet?
**A:**

### Q65: What's self-employment tax?
**A:** Taxes you pay as self-employed (both employer and employee portion):
- Social Security: ~12.4%
- Medicare: ~2.9%
- Total: ~15.3% on net profit

If you make $50,000 profit, ~$7,650 goes to self-employment tax.

### Q66: How do I reduce self-employment tax?
**A:**
1. Maximize deductions (reduces profit, reduces tax)
2. Form S-Corp or LLC with S-Corp election (if profit >$60k)
3. Contribute to retirement plan (reduces taxable profit)

S-Corp election can save $3,000-$5,000+/year if profitable.

### Q67: When do I need to make quarterly estimated tax payments?
**A:** If you expect to owe $1,000+ in taxes:
- Q1 (April 15): January-March estimated tax
- Q2 (June 15): April-May estimated tax
- Q3 (Sept 15): June-Aug estimated tax

- Can be substantial (couple percent of taxes owed)

Better to estimate and pay quarterly. Adjust if actual differs from estimate.

### Q69: What's a home office deduction and is it worth it?
**A:**
- **Simplified**: $5/sq ft/month (example: 300 sq ft = $1,500/year)
- **Actual**: Percentage of home expenses

**Worth it?** Yes, but beware: May trigger capital gains tax if you sell home later (depreciation recapture). Consult accountant if planning home sale soon.

### Q70: Can I deduct my commute?

**A:**
- **Yes**: If they actually do work (must be reasonable wage for work performed)
- **Document**: Hours worked, duties, rate paid
- **Payroll**: Must properly report and withhold taxes
- **Avoid**: "Paying" family member nothing or unreasonable amounts (audit risk)

Pay reasonable wage for actual work.

### Q72: What's the home office depreciation trap?
**A:**
- Claiming home office depreciates the home portion
- When you sell: Must recapture depreciation (pay tax on it)
- Example: Claimed $10,000 depreciation, sell home: $10,000 × 25% tax = $2,500 extra tax owed

Consider if you plan to sell. Use simplified method to avoid this.

### Q73: Can I deduct office furniture and equipment?
**A:**
- Office furniture: Often depreciated over 7 years
- Computers/equipment: Often over 3-5 years
- Under threshold: Often fully deductible year 1 ($2,500 limit varies)

**A:** Retirement plan for self-employed:
- Contribution limit: Higher than SEP-IRA

Good for self-employed with decent profit wanting to save aggressively for retirement.

### Q75: Can I deduct business losses against other income?
**A:**
- **Yes**: Loss can offset other income (salary, investments, etc.)
- **Limit**: Special rules for passive losses (real estate, etc.)
- **Carryforward**: Can use losses in future years if current year has other income

Example: Business loss of $20,000 can offset $20,000 of other income.

- **USA**: April 15 (for calendar year)
- **Canada**: June 15 for business (varies)
- **UK**: January 31 (for previous tax year)
- **Australia**: October 31

File deadline varies by country. Check your location.

### Q78: What if I miss a deduction this year?
**A:**
- Usually can amend return (costs extra)
- Have limited time to amend (1-3 years depending on country)
- Not worth amending unless deduction is substantial ($1,000+)

**Prevention**: Keep good bookkeeping. Review deductions quarterly.

### Q79: What's the difference between personal and business income tax rates?
**A:** Varies by country:
- **Some countries**: Same rate
- **Some countries**: Corporate rate is lower (tax incentive for business structures)
- **Some countries**: Personal rate higher if over certain income

Example: USA, corporate rate 21%, personal rate 10-37%. Often cheaper to incorporate.

### Q80: Should I pay myself as salary or owner draw?
**A:**
- **Salary**: You're employee (withhold taxes, pay payroll taxes)

## Financial Management

### Q81: How much should I charge for my services?
**A:** Multiple methods:
1. **Cost-plus**: (Cost × 50-100% markup)
2. **Hourly**: Set hourly rate × hours required
3. **Value-based**: Based on value to customer (highest margin)
4. **Market-based**: Match or slightly undercut competitors

**Reality**: Most entrepreneurs underprice. Test raising prices—often you lose 0-1 customers but profit increases 40-50%.

### Q82: When should I raise my prices?
**A:**
- At least annually (to keep up with inflation)
- When demand exceeds supply
- When customers consistently say "yes" without negotiation
- Every 10-15% increase, expect to lose 1-2 customers

Raising prices gradually is better than large jumps.

### Q83: How do I handle customer payment terms?
**A:**
- **Best for cash flow**: Upfront (full payment before work)
- **Reasonable**: 50% upfront, 50% on completion
- **Risky**: Net 30 (payment 30 days after invoice)
- **Avoid**: Net 45+ (too much cash float needed)

Can offer discount for early/upfront payment.

### Q84: What payment methods should I accept?
**A:** Depends on business:
- **Credit cards**: Easy for customers, 2-3% fee
- **Bank transfer**: No fee, slower
- **Cash**: No fee, tracking issues
- **PayPal**: Easy, ~3% fee
- **Stripe/Square**: Modern, 2-3% fee

Accept multiple methods. Card fees add up—price accordingly.

### Q85: How do I collect from late-paying customers?
**A:**
1. Send friendly reminder when due
2. After 7 days: Follow up email/call
3. After 30 days: Formal notice
4. After 60 days: Consider legal action or write off

**Prevention**: Get deposits, set clear terms, invoice immediately.

### Q86: Should I offer a discount for early payment?
**A:**
- Example: 2% off if paid within 10 days vs. 30-day terms
- Improves cash flow
- Customers value the discount more than 2% cost to you
- Good incentive

Worth testing.

### Q87: How do I set an emergency fund?
**A:**
- **Goal**: 3-6 months of business expenses
- **Amount**: If costs are $3,000/month, goal is $9,000-$18,000
- **Source**: Set aside 10-15% of revenue monthly
- **Location**: Separate savings account (not business checking)

This covers you if revenue dips or unexpected expenses hit.

### Q88: What's a realistic profit margin for my business?
**A:** Depends on industry:
- **Consulting/Services**: 40-60% (high margin, personal time)
- **E-commerce**: 20-40% (product cost eats margin)
- **Retail**: 5-15% (volume business, thin margin)
- **Tech SaaS**: 70-80% (digital product, low incremental cost)
- **Manufacturing**: 20-35% (equipment/labor heavy)

Know your industry benchmark.

### Q89: How do I handle slow months financially?
**A:**
- Emergency fund (planned for this)
- Line of credit (backup source)
- Adjust expenses (reduce discretionary spending)
- Accelerate marketing (try to boost next month)
- Seasonal business? Expect and plan for it

Seasonal businesses should save during peak months for slow months.

### Q90: When should I hire my first employee?
**A:** When:
- You can't handle all the work profitably
- One person generates 3x their salary in revenue
- You're turning away work due to capacity

**Example**: If salary costs $3,000/month, they need to generate $9,000+/month revenue.

### Q91: What costs increase when you hire an employee?
**A:**
- Salary
- Payroll taxes (~7-13% of salary)
- Benefits (health insurance, etc.)
- Equipment and workspace
- Admin time
- Training time

Total cost is typically 130-150% of salary. Plan accordingly.

### Q92: Should I start as sole proprietor or form a company?
**A:**
- **Sole proprietor**: Simpler, cheaper, less liability protection
- **LLC/Corp**: More complex, more cost, liability protection

**Rule**: Start simple. Upgrade structure when profit >$75k or liability risk increases.

### Q93: How do I know if I should become a corporation?
**A:** Consider when:
- Profit >$75,000/year (tax savings can exceed costs)
- Liability risk high (professional, service)
- Want to raise investment
- Need liability protection
- Have employees

Incorporation cost: $500-2,000. Annual cost: $500-1,000. Tax savings often exceed $5,000/year.

### Q94: What financial metrics should I track monthly?
**A:** Essential:
- Total revenue
- Total profit
- Profit margin
- Monthly cash balance
- Key ratio (revenue per customer, etc.)

Also track:
- Customer count
- Average transaction size
- Customer acquisition cost
- Top 3 products/services by revenue

### Q95: How do I know if my business is healthy?
**A:**
1. ✓ Profitable (profit > 0)
2. ✓ Growing (revenue increasing)
3. ✓ Sustainable (can maintain without being overworked)
4. ✓ Margin improving (or stable)
5. ✓ Expenses under control (not growing faster than revenue)
6. ✓ Customer retention (repeat customers)

If any of these are failing, needs attention.

### Q96: When should I hire a bookkeeper vs. accountant?
**A:**
- **Bookkeeper**: Daily transaction tracking, monthly reports (~$200-500/month)
- **Accountant**: Tax planning, tax returns, strategy (~$1,000-5,000/year)

Both serve different purposes. Many hire both.

### Q97: How often should I review my business finances?
**A:**
- **Weekly**: Glance at bank balance (5 min)
- **Monthly**: Full review, P&L, cash flow (1-2 hours)
- **Quarterly**: Deep dive, trends, adjustments (2-3 hours)
- **Annually**: Full tax planning, year review (4-8 hours)

Regular review catches problems early.

### Q98: What questions should I ask my bookkeeper?
**A:**
- "Are all my transactions recorded correctly?"
- "What's my actual profit this month?"
- "Is cash flow tracking profit?"
- "Did I miss any deductions?"
- "What should I adjust next month?"

A good bookkeeper answers these clearly.

### Q99: How do I know if my business is viable?
**A:**
1. Can you break even? (Revenue covers costs)
2. Can you make profit? (Revenue > costs consistently)
3. Can you scale? (Can earn more without proportionally more work)
4. Do customers want it? (Repeat business, positive feedback)

If yes to all four, viable and worth continuing.

### Q100: What's the biggest financial mistake women entrepreneurs make?
**A:** **Not tracking their numbers.**

Result:
- Overpay taxes
- Don't know profitability
- Make decisions based on guesses
- Slow business growth
- Stress at tax time

**Solution**: Spend 1-2 hours/month on bookkeeping. Transforms everything.
