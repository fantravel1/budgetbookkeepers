# Mergers & Acquisitions: Buying & Selling Businesses

## Acquisition (Buying a Business)

### Due Diligence (Financial Investigation)

**Revenue verification**:
- Tax returns vs. claimed revenue
- Customer contracts (are they real?)
- Concentration (% from top customers)
- Recurring vs. one-time (what's sustainable?)

**Expense verification**:
- Supplier contracts (locking in rates?)
- Employee costs (are they realistic?)
- Owner adjustments (what's truly operational?)

**Assets**:
- Equipment condition and market value
- Inventory (sellable or obsolete?)
- Intangible assets (brand, customer list, IP)

**Liabilities**:
- Debt outstanding
- Lawsuits or legal issues
- Tax liabilities
- Pending contracts ending

### Valuation Methods

**Multiple of Revenue**:
- SaaS: 8-12x revenue
- Services: 2-4x revenue
- Products: 1-3x revenue

Example: $1M revenue SaaS = $8-12M valuation

**Multiple of EBITDA**:
- EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, Amortization)
- Multiple: 5-10x depending on industry
- Example: $500k EBITDA × 7x = $3.5M valuation

**Asset-Based**:
- Value of assets minus liabilities
- Used when company not profitable
- Usually lower valuation

**Discounted Cash Flow**:
- Project future cash flows, discount back to present
- Most accurate but requires assumptions
- Can vary significantly based on assumptions

### Deal Structure

**All-Cash**:
- Pay upfront
- No contingencies
- High cost

**Stock**:
- Pay with your company's stock
- Seller shares in growth
- Tax-efficient (usually)

**Earnout**:
- Pay upfront + additional based on performance
- Seller incentivized to stay and perform
- Risk: Seller may leave before earnout period

### Financing the Acquisition

**Options**:
- Cash on hand (if you have it)
- Bank financing (SBA loans common for acquisitions)
- Seller financing (seller finances part)
- Stock deal (your stock as payment)

**Example**:
- Target valued at $2M
- You have $400k cash
- Bank SBA loan: $800k (40%)
- Seller finances: $800k (earnout/note)
- Your cash: $400k (20%)

## Divestiture (Selling Your Business)

### Preparing to Sell

**1-2 Years Before Sale**:
- Clean up financials (accurate bookkeeping)
- Document customer contracts
- Strengthen management team (buyer wants this)
- Ensure all compliance/licenses current
- Reduce owner dependency

**What kills deals**:
- Inaccurate financials
- Owner is the business (can't function without them)
- Customer concentration (70% from one customer)
- Legal issues or compliance problems

### Valuation (As Seller)

**Your goal**: Maximize valuation

**Factors increasing value**:
- Growing revenue (30%+ annual growth)
- Recurring revenue (predictable)
- Diverse customers (no concentration)
- Strong gross margins (70%+)
- Excellent team (independent of owner)
- Defensible competitive advantage

**Factors decreasing value**:
- Flat/declining revenue
- One-time sales
- Customer concentration
- Thin margins
- Owner-dependent
- Commoditized business

### Selling Process

**1. Prepare**:
- Clean financials
- Document everything
- Identify buyer profile
- Hire investment banker/broker (if significant deal)

**2. Create offering memo**:
- Business overview
- Financial history and projections
- Growth strategy
- Key assets (team, customers, IP)

**3. Identify and approach buyers**:
- Strategic buyers (competitors, larger players)
- Financial buyers (PE firms, individual investors)
- Passive investors (some capital)

**4. Due diligence**:
- Buyer investigates your business
- Answer questions, provide documents
- Address concerns

**5. Negotiate**:
- Price, terms, earnouts, non-competes
- May have multiple offers
- Choose best overall deal (not just highest price)

**6. Close**:
- Legal documentation
- Money transfer
- Transition period

## Financial Considerations

### Capital Gains Tax

**Long-term capital gains** (>1 year ownership):
- US: 15-20% federal
- State taxes vary (0-13%)
- Total: 15-33% depending on state

**Example**:
- Sold business for $5M
- Original investment $1M
- Capital gain: $4M
- Tax (25% effective): $1M
- Net to seller: $4M

**Tax planning**: Consider timing of sale, location, structure.

### Earnout Tax Treatment

**Earnout payments** (paid over time):
- Treated as capital gains if business asset
- But may be ordinary income in some cases
- Timing matters (when you recognize gain)

### Stock Deal Tax (Deferral)

**Selling stock for buyer's stock**:
- Can defer capital gains (Section 1031 exchange)
- Powerful tax tool if buyer stock appreciates
- Risk: Buyer stock may decline

## Post-Sale Considerations

### Non-Compete & Non-Solicitation

**Typical terms**:
- Non-compete: Can't start competing business (1-3 years)
- Non-solicitation: Can't recruit employees or customers (1-2 years)
- Breach = penalties (can lose earnout)

### Earn-Out Period

If part of consideration is earnout:

**Challenges**:
- Seller wants high performance, buyer wants to cut costs
- Misaligned incentives
- Seller may not have control
- Buyer may claim targets not met

**Mitigation**:
- Clear, objective metrics in earnout agreement
- Seller stays involved
- Regular communication

## M&A Financial Wisdom

**Most sellers are emotional about their business, which clouds judgment.**

Decide your price beforehand, stick to it. Don't fall in love with the deal.

Walk away from bad deals, even when you "think" you should accept.
