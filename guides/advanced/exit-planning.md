## Tax Planning for Exit

### Capital Gains
- Long-term (>1 year): 15-20% federal
- State taxes: 0-13%
- Plan timing (do you want sale in 2024 or 2025?)

### Sell Stock vs. Assets
- **Stock sale**: You pay tax (capital gains)
- **Asset sale**: Buyer pays more (covers their depreciation), you pay tax
- Usually structured as asset sale with seller adjustment

### Earnout Tax
- Earnout payments treated as capital gains if structured correctly
- Recognition timing (when do you recognize income?)
- State tax considerations

### 1099 Contractor Status
- If you'll consult post-sale, terms matter for taxes
- Salary vs. 1099 has different tax treatments

## Common Exit Planning Mistakes

### ❌ Waiting Too Long
- Market window closes
- Business matures, growth slows
- Valuation peaks earlier than you think

### ❌ Over-dependent Owner
- Buyer worried about whether business survives post-sale
- Major valuation discount
- Should have built management team years ago

### ❌ Ignoring Customer Concentration
- 60% from one customer = major discount
- Would have taken 2 years to fix
- Now stuck

### ❌ Poor Financial Records
- Buyer doubts accuracy
- Valuation discount
- Surprises in due diligence

### ❌ Not Planning Taxes
- Sale executed, surprise $1M tax bill
- Could have planned to reduce it 30-50%
- Now stuck paying full amount

---

## Post-Exit Transition

### Earn-Out Performance
- Often 20-40% of consideration
- Paid over 1-3 years
- Based on hitting targets
- Stay focused to maximize

### Non-Compete
- Legally bound not to compete (1-3 years typical)
- Breach = consequences
- Plan next venture accordingly

### Integration
- Buyer integrating your business
- Your job may change
- Customer relationships shift (you're now employee, not owner)
- Culture clash possible

## Exit Planning Financial Wisdom

**Most entrepreneurs don't plan exit seriously until 1 year before.**

That's too late.

Start planning 5 years before exit by:
1. Building clean financials
2. Reducing owner dependency
3. Growing revenue predictably
4. Diversifying customer base
5. Improving margins

Exit preparation is really "building a valuable business."
