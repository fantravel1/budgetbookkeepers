## Critical Financial Metrics by Stage

### Revenue Growth Rate
- Stage 1: 50-100%+/year (reaching $100k)
- Stage 2: 40-80%/year (growth phase)
- Stage 3: 30-50%/year (scaling efficiently)

### Operating Margin
- Stage 1: 10-30% (founder overhead low)
- Stage 2: 5-15% (overhead rising as you hire)
- Stage 3: 15-25% (economies of scale)

### Working Capital Days
Cash tied up in operations:
- Stage 1: 0-30 days (if cash business)
- Stage 2: 30-90 days (credit terms)
- Stage 3: 30-60 days (optimized)

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Stage 1: $0-100 (referrals, organic)
- Stage 2: $100-500 (paid marketing)
- Stage 3: $200-1000 (efficient at scale)

**Rule**: CAC payback <12 months

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Target: CLV > 3x CAC (ideally 5x+)
- Stage 3: CLV should improve (better retention)

## Scaling Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Working Capital Crunch

**Problem**: Growing to $500k requires more cash than you have.

**Example**:
- Month 1-12: $100k revenue, cash generated covers costs
- Month 13-18: Scale to $500k requires 5x inventory (if product)
- Accounts receivable balloon (if credit sales)
- Need $200k+ cash to fund growth

**Solutions**:
- Get business line of credit ($50-100k)
- Negotiate supplier terms (60/90 days)
- Get customer deposits upfront
- Use invoice factoring (advance receivables)

### 2. Margin Compression

**Problem**: Scaling requires hiring, overhead increases, margins shrink.

**Example**:
- $100k revenue: 30% margin = $30k profit
- Add staff ($50k salary): Margin drops to 20% = $20k profit on $100k sales
- Need to grow to $300k just to maintain profit dollars (from $30k to $60k)

**Solution**:
- Raise prices 10-15% as you scale
- Improve efficiency (systems, automation)
- Cut low-margin offerings

### 3. Cash Flow vs. Profit

**Problem**: "We're profitable but out of cash!"

**Example**:
- Month 1: $50k sales, $30k costs = $20k profit
- But: Paid $40k for inventory upfront, haven't paid utilities
- Cash position: -$20k (despite profitable P&L)

**Solution**:
- Monthly cash flow forecast (separate from profit)
- Conservative receivables collection assumption
- Line of credit for gap

### 4. Pricing Power

**Problem**: Price doesn't scale with growth expectations.

**Example**:
- Service A: $100/unit, need 10,000 units at $100k to reach $1M = impossible
- Service B: $1,000/unit, need 1,000 units at same revenue = scalable

**Solution**:
- As you scale, increase prices (market will bear it)
- Add premium tier (higher margin)
- Bundle offerings (increase average order value)

### 5. Employee Productivity Decline

**Problem**: As you grow, productivity per employee can drop.

**Example**:
- Revenue/employee at $100k: $100k
- Revenue/employee at $500k: $250k (still good)
- Revenue/employee at $1M: $400k (efficiency gained)

But if you hire too many or wrong people:
- Revenue/employee at $1M: $150k (problem!)

**Solution**:
- KPI tracking by employee
- Regular productivity reviews
- Compensation aligned with productivity

## Financial Planning for Scaling

### 18-Month Rolling Forecast

Create month-by-month projection:

**Example**:
- Month 1-3: Current state $100k/month revenue
- Month 4-6: $120k/month (20% growth)
- Month 7-9: $140k/month (accelerating)
- Month 10-12: $170k/month (slowing as market saturates)
- Month 13-18: $200k/month (plateauing unless new market)

Update monthly based on actuals.

### Scenario Planning

Create three scenarios:

**Conservative** (50% of plan):
- Growth stalls, need to cut costs
- How would business survive?

**Base Case** (100% of plan):
- Expected growth trajectory

**Aggressive** (150% of plan):
- Exceed targets, need more capital
- Will you have resources?

## Financing Growth

### Debt (Easiest, Cheapest)
- Business line of credit: 6-12% interest
- SBA loans: 6-9% interest
- Invoice factoring: 2-6% fees

Pros: No dilution, keep control
Cons: Fixed payments, covenant requirements

### Equity (Growth Capital)
- Angel investment: $25-100k at 5-20% equity
- Venture capital: $250k-1M+ at 15-40% equity
- Accelerators: $20-50k at 5-10% equity

Pros: Capital without debt, mentorship
Cons: Dilution, loss of control, pressure for growth

### Bootstrap/Retained Earnings
- Reinvest profits
- Slower growth, retain control
- Risky if market moves fast

## Hiring for Scale

### Who to Hire First
1. **Operations/delivery**: Your time is valuable, hire to free it
2. **Sales**: Revenue generates growth capital
3. **Admin**: So you can focus on strategy

### Salary vs. Productivity

Don't hire based on "we can afford it" mentality.

**Example**:
- Employee salary: $50k
- Expected revenue generation: $250k (5x multiple)
- Expected profit contribution: $100k (20% margin)

Hire only if ROI is 2x+ salary.

### Contractor vs. Employee

**Contractors**:
- Flexible, on-demand
- 1099, less benefits
- Lower loyalty
- Good for: Temporary needs, specialized skills

**Employees**:
- Committed, aligned
- Benefits, taxes, compliance
- Higher loyalty
- Good for: Core functions, long-term roles

## Common Scaling Mistakes

### ❌ Growing Too Fast
Scaling faster than operations can handle = quality collapse = customer loss.

### ❌ Hiring Without Systems
Add people before you have systems = chaos.

### ❌ Ignoring Unit Economics
Chasing revenue growth without checking profit per unit = scaling losses.

### ❌ Lack of Cash Flow Visibility
"We're profitable!" doesn't mean cash exists.

### ❌ Diluting Through Equity Too Early
Raise only what you need, when you need it.

## Scaling Financial Wisdom

**Most scaling failures aren't revenue problems—they're cash problems.**

You can be growing 100%/year and run out of cash if you don't manage working capital.

Get control of cash flow before chasing revenue.
