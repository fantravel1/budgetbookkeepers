# Fundraising & Capital Strategy

## Types of Funding & Financial Impact

### Bootstrapping (No Dilution)
**Method**: Reinvest profits, personal savings, friends/family

Pros:
- Keep control and equity
- No obligations to investors
- Build business profitably

Cons:
- Slower growth
- Limited by available cash
- Miss market opportunities

**Timeline**: 2-5 years to profitable/scalable

### Friends & Family ($25-100k)
**Method**: Raise from network, usually simple notes or equity

Pros:
- Patient capital
- Less scrutiny than VCs
- Can structure flexibly

Cons:
- Relationship risk
- Must still perform
- Small amount relative to needs

**Timeline**: 3-6 months

### Angel Investment ($50-500k)
**Method**: Individual investors, often with business experience

Pros:
- Material capital
- Mentorship value
- Can lead to VC

Cons:
- Loss of equity (10-20% typical)
- Expectations high
- Investor involvement possible

**Financial terms**:
- Valuation: $1-10M (varies wildly)
- Equity: 10-20% stake
- Dilution: Major if you raise again

### Venture Capital ($250k-10M+)
**Method**: Institutional investors, focus on high growth

Pros:
- Material capital for scaling
- Network and mentorship
- Validation (credibility)

Cons:
- Significant dilution (20-40%+)
- Loss of control (board seats)
- Pressure to grow/exit
- All-or-nothing mentality

**Financial terms**:
- Valuation: $5-50M+ (negotiated)
- Equity: 20-40% dilution per round
- Series A, B, C, etc.

### Debt Funding (SBA Loans, Lines of Credit)
**Method**: Borrow money, pay back with interest

Pros:
- No dilution
- Keep control
- Cheaper than equity (if qualified)

Cons:
- Personal guarantee (you're liable)
- Fixed payments (burden if revenue drops)
- Requires cash flow to service

**Financial terms**:
- Rate: 6-12% depending on credit
- Term: 3-10 years
- Covenant: Usually revenue/cash flow requirements

## Financial Due Diligence for Raising

Investors will scrutinize:

### 1. Revenue & Growth
- Actual revenue (not projected)
- YoY growth rate (30%+ required for VC)
- Revenue concentration (one customer = risky)
- Recurring vs. one-time

### 2. Unit Economics
- CAC (customer acquisition cost)
- CLV (customer lifetime value)
- LTV:CAC ratio (should be 3:1+)
- Payback period (under 12 months)

### 3. Profitability Path
- Current gross margin (60%+ for SaaS)
- Operating margin trend (improving?)
- Path to profitability (clear or vague?)
- Burn rate (months of runway)

### 4. Market Size
- Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)
- Growth rate of market
- Competitive position

### 5. Team
- Founder experience
- Key employee retention
- Advisory board
- Depth (can survive founder loss?)

## Valuation & Dilution

### How Startup Value is Calculated

**By stage**:
- Pre-revenue: $100k-500k (idea + team)
- Early revenue (<$1M): $1-5M (traction)
- Growth (<$10M): $10-50M (clear business model)
- Late stage (>$10M): $50M+ (negotiated, often 8-10x revenue)

**Valuation methods**:
- Comparable (similar companies valued at X)
- Revenue multiple (10x trailing revenue, varies)
- Discounted cash flow (projected profits discounted back)
- Market (what will investor pay?)

### Dilution Mathematics

**Example**: Founded company, worth $2M pre-funding

**Raise $500k at $2M valuation**:
- Investor gets 20% equity ($500k / $2.5M = 20%)
- You retain 80%
- But: Your $2M stake now worth $1.6M (diluted)

**Raise another $1M at $5M valuation (Series A)**:
- New investor gets 20% ($1M / $5M)
- Previous investor diluted to 16% (80% × 80%)
- You diluted to 64% (80% × 80%)

By Series C, founders often own 30-50%.

## Pitch Deck & Financial Projections

### What Investors Want to See

**Problem**: What pain point?
**Solution**: How you solve it
**Market**: How big? Growing?
**Business Model**: How you make money
**Traction**: What've you achieved?
**Financial Projections**: Next 3-5 years
**The Ask**: How much raise, use of funds
**Team**: Who's executing?

### Financial Projections (Be Conservative)

**Red flags that repel investors**:
- Revenue projections 10x current (unrealistic)
- No profitability path
- Massive burn rate without path to efficiency
- Low TAM (market too small)
- No unit economics

**Green flags**:
- Conservative projections (beat them)
- Clear path to profitability
- Strong unit economics
- Large TAM
- Experienced team

### Conservative Projection Example

**Year 1**: $2M revenue (based on current traction)
**Year 2**: $5M (2.5x growth, realistic)
**Year 3**: $12M (2.4x growth, market expansion)

Investors expect 30-50% annual growth for VC.

## Use of Funds

Be specific about how money is spent:

**Example - $1M raise**:
- Sales & marketing: $300k (hiring, ads, tools)
- Product development: $400k (engineering, tools)
- Operations: $200k (accounting, legal, admin)
- Runway: 12-18 months

Bad example: "Growth and operations" (too vague).

---

## Term Sheet Negotiation

**Key terms**:
- **Valuation**: How much is company worth?
- **Equity**: What % to investor?
- **Liquidation preference**: In exit, who gets paid first?
- **Anti-dilution**: Protection if next round values lower?
- **Board seat**: Investor gets voice?
- **Information rights**: Investor gets financial reports?

**Common mistake**: Founders accept bad terms to get funding fast.

### Liquidation Preference (Critical)

**1x Non-participating preferred**:
- Investor gets their money back, rest split normally
- Fair to all

**2x Participating preferred**:
- Investor gets 2x their money back, THEN shares rest
- Very investor-friendly
- Bad for founders

**Example** - $5M exit:
- 1x preferred: Investor gets $1M, founders get $4M (fair)
- 2x preferred: Investor gets $2M, founders get $3M (investor wins)

---

## After Fundraising (Financial Management)

### Burn Rate Management
- Know monthly burn (cash spent vs. revenue)
- Track to projections
- Runway (months until out of cash)
- Adjust if not hitting targets

**Example**:
- Monthly burn: $100k
- Revenue: $30k
- Net burn: $70k
- Cash: $700k
- Runway: 10 months

### Investor Communications
- Monthly or quarterly updates
- Transparent about progress
- Address miss-fires early
- Build trust

### Milestones & Next Funding
- Hit targets to raise next round
- Late-stage companies raise when doing well (not when desperate)
- Plan funding cycles (every 18-24 months ideally)

## Common Fundraising Mistakes

### ❌ Raising Too Little
"We'll just raise $100k to get started"

Reality: Will need $500k+ to grow meaningfully. Raise enough for 18-24 months.

### ❌ Giving Away Too Much Equity Too Early
Gives 40% to first investor, dilutes rest away.

### ❌ Bad Dilution Planning
By Series C, founders often own <30%, which changes incentives.

### ❌ Unrealistic Projections
Project 10x growth when competitors show 2-3x.

Investors want conservative projections you can beat.

### ❌ Not Raising Enough Runway
Raises $500k at 3-month burn rate = 6 months runway + 3 months fundraising = panic.

## Fundraising Financial Wisdom

**Raise when you don't need to, not when you do.**

Investors invest in momentum, not desperation. Raise when:
- Traction is clear
- Growth rate impressive
- Runway comfortable (12+ months)
- Valuation improving

Don't fundraise when:
- Desperate (3 months runway)
- Growth stalled
- Unclear path forward
