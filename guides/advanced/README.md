## Key Concepts Across Guides

### Financial Metrics Consistency
All guides reference:
- **Operating Margin**: Profit after operating expenses (20-30% healthy)
- **Gross Margin**: Profit before operating expenses (40-80% depending on industry)
- **CAC/LTV**: Customer acquisition cost vs. lifetime value (3-5x ratio healthy)
- **Runway**: Months until cash runs out
- **Working Capital**: Cash tied up in operations

### Valuation Philosophy
- **Rule of thumb**: Mature businesses 3-10x revenue or 5-10x EBITDA
- **Stage-based**: Pre-revenue $100k-500k, early $1-5M, growth $10-50M, scale 8-10x revenue
- **Strategic premium**: Buyer willing to pay more than financial value if synergies exist

### Financial Discipline
- **Conservative planning**: Under-promise, over-deliver
- **Clean books**: Accurate financials non-negotiable for serious capital
- **Documentation**: Every decision documented and justified
- **Regular review**: Monthly/quarterly financial review non-negotiable
