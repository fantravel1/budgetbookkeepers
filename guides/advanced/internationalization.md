- Competitive pricing
- Labor costs vs. home country
- Tax rates and compliance costs

- Tariffs and trade costs

**Question**: Is market attractive financially?

### Entry Method Decision

- Full compliance burden
- Highest control

**Joint Venture**:
- Local partner
- Shared ownership

## Financial Challenges

### 1. Multi-Currency Management

**Problem**: Revenue in foreign currency, costs potentially in multiple currencies.

**Example**:
- USA-based: Revenue $100,000 USD
- Europe sales: €80,000 (at $1.10 = $88,000 USD)
- Employee in Canada: Pay $30,000 CAD (at $0.75 = $22,500 USD)
- Net: Depends on timing of conversion

**Solution**:
- Monthly currency reconciliation
- Hedge major exposures (forward contracts, options)
- Account for exchange gains/losses on P&L

### 2. Tax on Worldwide Income

Many countries tax worldwide income:

**Example - USA based, expanding to UK**:
- USA taxes: Global income
- UK taxes: UK-source income
- Double taxation risk

**Solution**:
- Foreign tax credits (don't pay tax twice)
- Tax treaties (often reduce double taxation)
- Transfer pricing (for intercompany transactions)

### 3. Transfer Pricing

If parent company and subsidiary:

**Example**:
- Parent sells products to subsidiary at "transfer price"
- Subsidiary marks up and sells
- IRS/tax authority: "Are prices reasonable?"

**Rules**:
- Must use "arm's length price" (what unrelated parties would charge)
- Document pricing methodology
- IRS scrutinizes aggressively

**Risk**: Mispricing = penalties + back taxes

### 4. Withholding Taxes

When paying dividends, interest, royalties across borders:

**Example**:
- US subsidiary profitable: $1,000,000 profit
- Pay dividend to parent in Canada
- Withholding tax: 5-15% (varies by treaty)
- Tax on dividend: $50-150,000

**Solution**:
- Plan distributions (don't automatically repatriate)
- Use tax treaties to minimize withholding
- Consider retained earnings vs. dividend

### 5. VAT/GST Complexity

Each country has VAT/sales tax:

**EU Example**:
- Product sold in Germany: 19% VAT
- Product sold in Luxembourg: 17% VAT
- Same product, different tax rates
- Filing and compliance in multiple countries

**USA Note**: No VAT (sales tax by state, complex rules)

## Operational Structure for International

### Subsidiary Structure

**Separate legal entity** in each country:

Pros:
- Limited liability (separate company protects parent)
- Tax efficiency possible
- Local tax incentives possible

Cons:
- Multiple tax returns, filings, compliance
- More accounting complexity
- Potential for double taxation

**Example**: Apple Inc. (USA) → Apple Sales International (Ireland) → Apple UK (UK)
Each entity files local returns, but structured for tax efficiency.

### Branch Structure

**Not separate entity**, extension of parent:

Pros:
- Simpler accounting (one entity)
- Single tax return (mostly)

Cons:
- No liability protection
- Profits taxed in both countries
- Less tax planning opportunity

## Key Financial Decisions

### Local Hiring vs. Outsourcing

**Hire local staff**:
- More control
- Higher compliance burden (labor law, taxes, benefits)
- Cost: Salary + benefits + payroll taxes
- Example: Germany: $50,000 salary = $65,000+ total cost (high payroll taxes)

**Outsource/Contractors**:
- Lower cost
- Less control
- Simpler (outsourcer handles compliance)
- Example: Outsource to contractor = 1099 handling, lower cost

**Decision**: By market and function.

### Pricing in Foreign Markets

**Same price globally?** Dangerous:
- Different purchasing power
- Different tax treatments
- Exchange rate changes
- Competitive differences

**Example**:
- Product costs $100 in USA, price $300
- Price same in India ($300 USD = 25,000 INR, unreasonable)
- Price in India: $150 USD (locals can afford it)
- Margin in India: Lower, but volume higher

### Accounting Method

**Centralized**: Record all in home country currency
- Simpler
- Less local accounting burden
- Poor visibility

**Decentralized**: Local books in local currency
- More complex
- Better local visibility
- Consolidate at parent (currency translation complexity)

## Tax Optimization for International

### Intellectual Property Strategy
- Hold IP in tax-efficient location (USA? Ireland? Luxembourg?)
- License to foreign subsidiaries
- Reduces taxable income in high-tax countries
- **Risk**: IRS scrutinizes this heavily

### Transfer Pricing Optimization
- Parent sells to subsidiary at price that allocates profit fairly
- R&D costs to low-tax country? (Usually not allowed)
- Manufacturing costs to high-tax country? (Allowed)

**Key**: Must document as arm's length.

### Loss Utilization
- Subsidiary in new market loses money initially
- Can parent use those losses? (Varies by country)
- Tax planning to maximize loss usage

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Ignoring Currency Risk
Currency swings can wipe out profits (or create unexpected gains).

### ❌ Underestimating Compliance Costs
Local accounting, tax filing, labor law compliance = expensive.

### ❌ Transfer Pricing Missteps
IRS/tax authorities aggressive on this; undocumented = penalties.

### ❌ Not Using Tax Treaties
Many small businesses don't leverage treaties; leave tax savings on table.

### ❌ Repatriating Too Early
Paying withholding tax on dividends before necessary.
