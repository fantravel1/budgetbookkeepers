## 💡 Key Concepts Across All Guides

### Profit vs. Cash Flow
The most important concept: You can have positive profit but be out of cash. Or have cash but negative profit. Understand both.

### Pricing Matters
Most entrepreneurs underprice. Increasing prices 10-15% often costs you 1-2 customers but increases profit 40-50%. Worth it.

### Deductions = Tax Savings
Every dollar of legitimate business expense reduces your taxes. From home office to equipment to professional development.

### Financial Systems = Freedom
Spend 10 hours/week setting up proper systems now. Save 5 hours/week forever. That's 250 hours/year.

### Professional Help = ROI
A bookkeeper at $500/month saves you 10+ hours/week. That's $240/hour value. Plus tax savings usually exceed the cost.
