# SaaS & Tech Startups: Financial Guide for Growth Stage

## Industry Overview

SaaS (Software as a Service) businesses have unique financial characteristics:
- **High margins** (70-80% common)
- **Recurring revenue** (MRR = Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- **Upfront customer acquisition costs**
- **Predictable growth metrics**
- **Venture capital considerations**

---

## Critical Metrics

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
Total predictable recurring revenue each month.

**Calculation**:
- Customer A: $500/month
- Customer B: $1,200/month
- Customer C: $300/month
- **MRR: $2,000/month**

**Why it matters**: Predictable cash flow, valuation metric, growth indicator.

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
Marketing spend ÷ New customers acquired

**Example**:
- Monthly marketing: $10,000
- New customers: 20
- CAC: $500/customer

**Rule**: Should recover CAC in 6-12 months through profit.

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
Total profit generated by customer over lifetime.

**Calculation**:
- Average monthly revenue per customer: $500
- Average customer lifetime: 24 months (2 years)
- Gross profit %: 75%
- CLV: $500 × 24 × 75% = $9,000

**Benchmark**: CLV should be 3-5x CAC.

### Churn Rate
% of customers leaving each month.

**Example**: Started month with 100 customers, ended with 90
- Churn: 10%

**Impact**: 10% monthly churn = 2.7 year average customer life
**Impact**: 5% monthly churn = 19 year average customer life

Critical to track and minimize.

### Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
MRR × 12

If MRR is $100k, ARR is $1.2M. Used for valuation and fundraising.

## Accounting Challenges

### 1. Revenue Recognition
Don't recognize full annual contract upfront. Recognize monthly as service is delivered.

**Wrong**:
- Customer signs 12-month contract for $12,000
- Record $12,000 income immediately
- Problem: If customer cancels month 2, you've overreported income

**Right**:
- Record $1,000 income each month
- Record $11,000 as "deferred revenue" (liability)
- As months pass, move from liability to income

### 2. Free Trial Impact
Free trial converts to paying customer or churns.

**Track**:
- Trial to paid conversion rate
- Trial length impact on conversion
- Trial CAC (support costs, infrastructure)

### 3. Deferred Revenue (Unearned Revenue)
Customer pays upfront, but you deliver over time.

**Example**:
- Customer pays $12,000 for annual contract Jan 1
- Jan: Record $1,000 income, $11,000 deferred revenue
- Feb: Record $1,000 income, $10,000 deferred revenue
- By Dec: $0 deferred, $12,000 total income recorded

This is proper accrual accounting.

### 4. Stock Options & Employee Compensation
Employees are often paid with stock/options.

**Accounting**:
- Stock options are expense (spread over vesting period)
- "Burn" includes option grants
- Track fully diluted cap table

### 5. Development Costs
Is software development an expense or capitalized asset?

**Rules vary** by accounting standard:
- Internal development: Often expensed
- Purchased software: Often capitalized and depreciated
- Hosting/SaaS tools: Expensed

## Unique SaaS Deductions

- **Stock option grants** (employee compensation)
- **Cloud infrastructure** (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **API/third-party services** (Stripe, auth providers)
- **Customer support staff** (often significant for SaaS)
- **R&D** (extensive for software companies)
- **Security & compliance** (SOC2, GDPR)

## Financial Stages

### Early Stage (Pre-Product Market Fit)
- Focus: Build product, find customers, ignore profitability
- Funding: Bootstrapped or angel/seed investment
- Metrics: User growth, engagement, churn rate
- Burn rate: Track closely (months of runway)

### Growth Stage (Product-Market Fit Found)
- Focus: Scale customer acquisition while maintaining churn control
- Funding: Series A/B venture capital typical
- Metrics: MRR growth, CAC, LTV, payback period
- Unit economics: Must show path to profitability

### Scale Stage (Path to Profitability Clear)
- Focus: Efficient growth, margin improvement
- Funding: Series C+ or growth equity
- Metrics: Rule of 40 (growth % + profit margin > 40%)
- Path: Clear route to profitable scale

## Key Financial Analysis

### Payback Period
How long to recover CAC through profit.

**Example**:
- CAC: $500
- Profit per customer per month: $300
- Payback: $500 ÷ $300 = 1.7 months
- Excellent (under 3 months ideal, 6 months max)

### Burn Rate
Monthly cash spent minus revenue earned.

**Example**:
- Monthly costs: $100,000
- Monthly revenue: $40,000
- Burn: $60,000/month

**Runway**: Cash ÷ Burn rate
- Cash: $600,000
- Burn: $60,000/month
- Runway: 10 months until out of money

Track burn closely. Adjust course if not hitting targets.

### Expansion Revenue
Revenue from existing customers (upsells, add-ons).

**Example**:
- CAC (customer acquisition): $10,000
- First year revenue: $5,000
- Expansion revenue: $2,000
- Year 2 revenue: $7,000

Expansion revenue is highly profitable (no CAC).

## Common SaaS Mistakes

### ❌ Ignoring Churn
5% monthly churn = slow death. Even with great growth, churn compounds.

### ❌ Optimizing for New Customers Only
Expansion revenue (upsells to existing customers) is most profitable.

### ❌ Not Tracking Unit Economics
If CAC is $10,000 and payback is 5 years, business isn't viable.

### ❌ Recognizing Revenue Incorrectly
Upfront payment ≠ immediate revenue for accounting.

### ❌ Ignoring Customer Concentration
If 30% of revenue from one customer, that's risk.

## Venture Capital & Accounting

If raising venture capital:

**Financial requirements**:
- Clean bookkeeping (auditable)
- Clear metrics dashboard
- Financial projections (3-5 years)
- Unit economics documented

**Cap table**:
- Track all shares, options, conversions
- Know fully diluted ownership
- Understand SAFEs/convertible notes

**Tax considerations**:
- 83(b) elections (stock vesting)
- Section 409A valuations (options)
- Equity incentive plans

---

## SaaS Financial Wisdom

**Most important metric**: **Payback period**

If CAC payback > 12 months, you're burning cash to acquire customers. Below 6 months? Highly sustainable.

Every dollar spent acquiring a customer should return 3-5 dollars over their lifetime.
