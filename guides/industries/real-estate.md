# Real Estate: Accounting & Financial Management Guide

## Industry Overview

Real estate has unique characteristics:
- **Capital intensive** (properties are major assets)
- **Long-term investments** (properties held 5-30+ years)
- **Multiple revenue streams** (rentals, flips, appreciation)
- **Tax advantages** (depreciation, deductions, 1031 exchanges)
- **Complex accounting** (depreciation recapture, capital gains)
- **Leverage heavy** (debt financing typical)

## Business Models

### Buy & Hold (Long-Term Rentals)
- Purchase property, rent for cash flow
- Hold 5-30+ years for appreciation
- Depreciation shields income
- Monthly passive income
- Example: $300k property → $2,000/month rent → $1,200/month net

### House Flipping
- Purchase, renovate, sell quickly (6-12 months)
- Goal: Profit from improvement + appreciation
- High cash requirement, lower hold time
- Example: $200k purchase + $50k renovations → $300k sale = $50k profit

### REIT/Portfolio Approach
- Multiple properties (10+)
- Diversified locations and types
- Professional management
- Passive income scale

## Critical Metrics

### Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)
Annual net operating income ÷ Property value

**Example**:
- Property value: $300,000
- Annual rental income: $30,000
- Annual expenses: $10,000
- NOI: $20,000
- Cap rate: $20,000 ÷ $300,000 = 6.7%

**Target**: 6-12% depending on market

### Cash-on-Cash Return
Annual cash flow ÷ Cash invested

**Example**:
- Invested: $50,000 (down payment)
- Annual cash flow: $15,000
- Cash-on-cash: 30%

**Target**: 15%+ is excellent

### Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)
Net operating income ÷ Debt payments

**Example**:
- NOI: $20,000/year
- Mortgage payment: $15,000/year
- DSCR: 1.33x

**Target**: 1.25x+ (lenders require 1.25x minimum)

### Vacancy Rate
Percentage of units empty/not generating income

**Target**: 5-10% (higher rates indicate problem areas)

## Accounting Challenges

### 1. Depreciation & Deferred Taxes

Depreciation is non-cash deduction:

**Example**:
- Property value: $300,000
- Building value (80%): $240,000
- Depreciation period: 27.5 years
- Annual depreciation: $8,727

This reduces taxes but when you sell, you "recapture" it.

### 2. Capital Gains vs. Ordinary Income

When you sell:
- Long-term capital gains (held >1 year): Lower tax rate (15-20%)
- Short-term capital gains (held <1 year): Ordinary income rates (24-37%)

Timing of sale matters significantly for taxes.

### 3. 1031 Exchange

Swap property for like-kind property, defer ALL taxes

**Rules**:
- Must be real property for real property
- Must identify replacement within 45 days
- Must close within 180 days
- No cash/equity can be taken out

Powerful tax tool if executed correctly.

### 4. Rental Expense Deductions

Fully deductible:
- Mortgage interest (not principal)
- Property taxes
- Insurance
- Repairs and maintenance
- Property management fees
- Utilities (if you pay)
- HOA fees
- Advertising (for tenants)

NOT deductible:
- Mortgage principal
- Capital improvements (depreciated instead)
- Personal expenses

---

## Unique Real Estate Deductions

- **Depreciation** (major: 27.5 years for rentals)
- **Mortgage interest** (significant expense)
- **Property taxes**
- **Insurance** (landlord or building)
- **Property management** (if hired)
- **Repairs & maintenance**
- **Vacancy losses** (if documented)
- **1099 contractor costs** (repairs, maintenance)
- **Home office** (if managing yourself)
- **Travel to properties** (inspections, tenant meetings)
- **Capital improvements** (depreciated over time)
- **Legal/accounting** (property setup, disputes)

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Confusing Repairs with Capital Improvements
- **Repairs**: Deductible immediately
- **Improvements**: Depreciated over 27.5 years

Misclassifying costs your much in taxes.

### ❌ Not Tracking Basis Correctly
Basis determines depreciation and capital gains. Wrong basis = tax problems.

### ❌ Ignoring 1031 Exchange Deadlines
45-day identification + 180-day closing windows are STRICT.

### ❌ Poor Tenant Records
Can't deduct repairs you can't document.

### ❌ Mixing Personal and Rental Property
IRS scrutinizes personal use in rental properties.

## Real Estate Financial Wisdom

**Best investment metric**: **Cash-on-cash return, not just appreciation**

Property that appreciates 10% but has negative cash flow is a liability, not an asset.

Focus on: Cap rate, DSCR, cash-on-cash return, and tenant quality.
