# Legal Services: Accounting & Practice Management

## Industry Overview

Legal practices have specific accounting needs:
- **Billable hours critical** (hourly billing is standard)
- **Client trust accounts** (holding client funds, separate accounting)
- **Retainer clients** (advance payments common)
- **Ethical billing requirements** (bar association rules)
- **High partner compensation** (profit sharing agreements)
- **Associate management** (salary + bonus structures)

---

## Critical Metrics

### Billable Utilization Rate
Hours billed ÷ Total hours worked

**Target**: 75-85% for partners, 80-90% for associates

Low utilization indicates administrative burden or inefficiency.

### Hourly Billing Rate
By experience level:

**Example**:
- Partners: $300-500+/hour
- Counsel/Senior Associates: $200-350/hour
- Associates: $150-250/hour
- Paralegals: $75-150/hour

Rate varies by location, practice area, reputation.

### Realization Rate
Actual collections ÷ Billable hours value

**Example**:
- 2,000 billable hours @ $200/hour = $400,000 potential
- Actually collected: $320,000
- Realization: 80%

High realization = strong collections.

### Client Profitability
Some clients are high-margin, others low-margin:
- Hourly clients: Often lower margin (discount-dependent)
- Retainer clients: Often higher margin (more predictable)

## Accounting Challenges

### 1. Client Trust Accounts (IOLTA)

Lawyers hold client funds (deposits, settlements, escrow):

**Rules**:
- Separate from firm operating account
- Interest-bearing (varies by state)
- Strict accounting requirements
- Subject to bar association audits

**Accounting**: Track separately, reconcile monthly.

### 2. Retainer Billing

Client pays upfront, work delivered over time:

**Example**:
- Retainer: $5,000
- Record as liability (unearned revenue)
- As work is done, recognize $X/month as revenue
- After 5 months at $1,000/month: All recognized

### 3. Unbilled Time

Work done but not yet billed:

**Example**:
- 50 hours completed
- Not yet billed to client
- Accrue as unbilled revenue

Track to catch billing delays.

### 4. Write-offs & Discounts

Often need to reduce bills:

**Example**:
- Client billed: $10,000
- Client disputes amount
- Final settlement: $8,000
- Write-off: $2,000 (25%)

Track write-off reasons to avoid patterns.

- **Office equipment** (legal-specific)
- **Paralegal training**
- **Bar association dues**
- **Ethics compliance training**
- **Office supplies**

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Poor Time Tracking
If you don't track hours accurately, you can't bill accurately.

### ❌ Write-offs Impacting Profitability
Excessive write-offs destroy margin. Track reasons.

### ❌ Client Trust Account Errors
Mixing trust account with operating account = bar violation.

### ❌ Underpricing
Many attorneys underprice relative to market.

### ❌ Not Collecting Retainers
Retainers are paid upfront for a reason.

## Legal Services Financial Wisdom

**Your practice's value = Realization rate × Billable hours × Hourly rate**

Improve any of three:
1. **Raise rates** (market will bear it)
2. **Increase billable hours** (efficiency improvements)
3. **Improve realization** (better collections, fewer write-offs)

Each 10% improvement = 10% more profit.
