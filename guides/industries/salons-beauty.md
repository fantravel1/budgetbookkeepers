## Key Metrics

### Average Ticket Size
Revenue per customer visit

**Example**:
- Monthly customers: 400
- Monthly revenue: $12,000
- Average ticket: $30

Track by service type (haircut $25, color service $75).

### Service Mix
Which services drive the most revenue

**Example**:
- Haircuts: 40% of revenue, 70% margin
- Color services: 35% of revenue, 60% margin
- Retail product sales: 15% of revenue, 50% margin
- Services: 10% of revenue, 80% margin

Focus on high-revenue, high-margin services.

### Stylist Productivity
Revenue per stylist per day

**Example**:
- Daily salon revenue: $600
- Number of stylists: 4
- Revenue per stylist: $150/day

Track and benchmark. Identifies underperforming stylists.

### Inventory Turnover
Retail inventory moves (products, supplies)

**Calculation**: Product revenue ÷ Average inventory

High turnover = fresh inventory, no aged stock.

## Accounting Challenges

### 1. Commission Payouts

Stylists often paid commission:

**Example**:
- Stylist generates $1,000 in services
- Commission rate: 50%
- Stylist payout: $500

**Accounting**:
- Service revenue: $1,000
- Stylist commission expense: $500
- Profit: $500

Track commission carefully (it's largest expense).

### 2. Prepaid Packages/Memberships

Customers pay upfront for packages:

**Example**:
- Customer pays $200 for 6 haircuts
- Record as liability (prepaid customer balance)
- As haircuts delivered, recognize revenue

Don't recognize full $200 as revenue day 1.

### 3. Tip Accounting

Cash tips create reconciliation challenges:

**Challenge**: Tip reported vs. actual tip received

**Accounting**:
- Card tips: Easy to track
- Cash tips: POS system estimates (can be inaccurate)
- Employee tips: Not your income, but affects payroll taxes

### 4. Product Inventory

Track retail products as inventory:

**Example**:
- Beginning inventory: $5,000
- Purchases: $3,000
- Ending inventory: $4,500
- COGS: $3,500
- Product sales: $8,000
- Profit: $4,500

Different from service profit.
