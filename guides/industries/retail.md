# Retail: POS, Inventory & Financial Management

## Industry Overview

Retail has unique characteristics:
- **High inventory** (tied-up capital)
- **POS system critical** (accurate point of sale data)
- **Shrinkage** (theft, damage, waste)
- **Seasonal variation** (holiday sales spikes)
- **Thin margins** (5-15% typical)
- **Location-based** (rent and traffic critical)
- **Employee-intensive** (wages are largest expense)

## Critical Metrics

### Gross Profit Margin
(Revenue - COGS) ÷ Revenue

**Target**: 40-50% (before shrinkage/theft)

**After Accounting for Reality**:
- Planned shrinkage: 2% of inventory
- Actual margin often: 38-48%

### Inventory Turnover
COGS ÷ Average inventory

**Example**:
- COGS/year: $300,000
- Average inventory: $60,000
- Turnover: 5x per year (inventory sits ~2.4 months)

**Target**: 4-6x depending on product

### Sales per Square Foot
Annual revenue ÷ Square feet of store

**Example**:
- Revenue: $500,000
- Square feet: 1,000
- Sales/sq ft: $500

**Target**: $300-600 (varies by retail type)

### Employee Productivity
Revenue per employee

**Example**:
- Revenue: $1,000,000
- Employees: 10 FTE
- Revenue/employee: $100,000

**Target**: $150,000-300,000 depending on store type

### Shrinkage Rate
Inventory loss ÷ Sales

**Example**:
- Sales: $500,000
- Inventory loss: $15,000
- Shrinkage: 3%

**Target**: <2% (higher indicates theft, damage, or recording errors)

## Accounting Challenges

### 1. Perpetual vs. Periodic Inventory

**Perpetual** (Recommended):
- Update inventory system after each sale
- Real-time COGS
- Requires POS system
- More accurate

**Periodic**:
- Count inventory monthly/quarterly
- Calculate COGS from counts
- Manual, error-prone
- Less common now

### 2. Shrinkage (Inventory Loss)

Sources of shrinkage:
- Theft (employee or customer)
- Damage
- Waste/expiration (perishables)
- Recording errors
- Receiving errors

**Accounting**: Record as COGS or separate loss line.

### 3. POS Integration

Modern retail requires POS system integration:
- Sales data accurate
- Inventory updates real-time
- Employee tracking
- Accounting integration (ideally)

**Poor integration**: Errors and reconciliation headaches.

### 4. Sales Returns

Customers return merchandise:

**Example**:
- Revenue: $100,000
- Returns: $5,000 (5%)
- Net revenue: $95,000

Track return rate by product (high returns = quality issue).

## Inventory Management

### Par Levels
How much inventory to keep on hand

**Example**:
- Fast-moving item: 10 units (weekly sell-through)
- Slow item: 3 units

Stock-outs lose sales. Overstocking ties up cash.

### ABC Analysis
Categorize inventory by value:
- **A**: High value items (80% of value, 20% of items)
- **B**: Medium value (15% of value, 30% of items)
- **C**: Low value (5% of value, 50% of items)

Focus inventory control on A and B items.

## Unique Retail Deductions

- **Shrinkage/theft losses** (if documented)
- **POS system costs** (software, hardware)
- **Inventory management software**
- **Store fixtures** (shelving, displays—depreciated)
- **Store rent**
- **Store utilities**
- **Signage and advertising** (in-store)
- **Credit card processing fees**
- **Employee training**

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Ignoring Shrinkage
Shrinkage of 3-5% compounds over year (massive profit killer).

### ❌ Overstocking Inventory
Ties up cash, increases shrinkage risk.

### ❌ Not Tracking by Product
Which products are profitable? Which are dogs?

### ❌ Poor POS System
Bad data = bad decisions.

### ❌ Not Managing Seasonal Spikes
Holiday inventory needs planning.

## Financial Management

**Critical Daily**:
- POS reconciliation

- Till audits

**Weekly**:
- Sales by category

## Seasonal Considerations

### Q4 (Holiday)
- 40-50% of annual revenue common
- Requires inventory investment Sept-Oct
- Staffing challenges
- Markdown planning for Jan-Feb

### Off-Season (Jan-Mar)

## Retail Financial Wisdom

**Most retail stores fail due to inventory management, not lack of sales.**

Too much inventory = cash crisis.
Shrinkage ignored = margin destruction.

Master inventory, and profitability follows.
