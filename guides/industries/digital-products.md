## Critical Metrics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
Total marketing ÷ New customers

**Example**:
- Email marketing: $0 (owned list)
- Ads: $500
- Affiliates: $300
- Total: $800
- New customers: 100
- CAC: $8/customer

**Target**: CAC should be <20% of product price

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
Total revenue from customer - CAC

**One-time purchase example**:
- Price: $97
- CAC: $20
- CLV: $77

**Subscription example**:
- Monthly fee: $29
- Average retention: 12 months
- CLV: $348
- CAC: $50 (ROI: 7x)

### Conversion Rate
% of visitors who purchase

**Example**:
- Website visitors: 10,000
- Purchases: 100
- Conversion rate: 1%

**Target**: 1-5% for digital products (higher than expected!)

### Average Order Value (AOV)
Average revenue per transaction

**Example**:
- Total revenue: $50,000
- Orders: 1,000
- AOV: $50

Upsells increase AOV significantly.

### Churn Rate (for Subscriptions)
% of subscribers canceling per month

**Example**:
- Subscribers: 1,000
- Canceled: 50
- Churn: 5%

**Target**: <5% monthly (critical for SaaS/subscriptions)

---

## Accounting Challenges

### 1. Revenue Recognition

When do you recognize revenue?

**One-time purchase**: At point of sale

**Subscription**: Monthly as delivered
- Customer pays $300 annual upfront
- Record $25/month as revenue
- Record $275 as deferred revenue liability initially

**Course with guarantee**: When refund period expires
- Sell $297 course with 30-day money-back guarantee
- Wait 30 days to recognize revenue (some people refund)

### 2. Refunds & Returns

Digital products often have high refund rates:

**Example**:
- Sales: $10,000
- Refunds: $1,500 (15% refund rate)
- Net revenue: $8,500

High refund rates indicate:
- Poor product quality
- Misaligned customer expectations
- Refund period too generous

### 3. Payment Processing Fees

Platforms take cuts:

**Stripe**: 2.9% + $0.30
**PayPal**: 2.9% + $0.30
**Gumroad**: 3.5% + $0.30
**Teachable**: 3% (higher if using their payment processor)

**Example**:
- Sales: $10,000
- Fees (3%): $300
- Net: $9,700
- Effective margin: 97% (still very high)

### 4. Affiliate Commissions

If using affiliates:

**Example**:
- Sales through affiliates: $5,000
- Affiliate commission (30%): $1,500
- Net: $3,500

Track affiliate sales separately (lower margin than direct).

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Ignoring Refund Rates
High refunds destroy profit. Track and improve product.

### ❌ Underpricing
Most digital product creators underprice significantly.

### ❌ Not Tracking CAC by Channel
Don't know which marketing channels are profitable.

### ❌ Ignoring Churn (Subscriptions)
Monthly churn of 10% = business dies in ~10 months.

### ❌ Creating Without Sales System
"If I build it, they will come" rarely works.
Build marketing first, product second.
