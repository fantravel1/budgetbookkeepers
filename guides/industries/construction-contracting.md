# Construction & Contracting: Financial Management Guide

## Industry Overview

Construction has unique financial characteristics:
- **Project-based** (each job is separate accounting)
- **Long contract cycles** (months from proposal to completion)
- **Complex labor** (wages, workers' comp, subcontractors)
- **Material sourcing** (cost management critical)
- **Equipment heavy** (trucks, tools, depreciation)
- **Progress billing** (payment in stages, not at completion)
- **Bonding requirements** (affects cash flow)

## Business Models

### General Contracting
- Bid projects, manage subcontractors
- Responsible for timeline and quality
- Profit margin: 10-20%

### Specialty Contracting
- Electrical, plumbing, HVAC, etc.
- Direct labor (your crew)
- Profit margin: 20-35%

### Build-to-Suit/Custom
- Build customer's specific home/project
- Higher profit, longer cycles
- Profit margin: 15-25%

### Residential vs. Commercial
- Residential: Faster cycles, smaller contracts
- Commercial: Longer cycles, larger contracts, stricter compliance

## Critical Metrics

### Gross Profit Margin by Project
(Revenue - Direct Costs) ÷ Revenue

**Example**:
- Contract: $100,000
- Labor: $30,000
- Materials: $20,000
- Subcontractors: $25,000
- Direct costs: $75,000
- Gross profit: $25,000 (25% margin)

**Target**: 20-30% gross margin

### Job Profitability
Not all projects are equally profitable:
- Some jobs: 35% margin (well-managed, good materials pricing)
- Others: 10% margin (misquoted, scope creep)

Track by project to identify patterns.

### Labor Cost %
Labor as % of contract price

**Example**:
- Contract: $100,000
- Labor cost: $35,000
- Labor %: 35%

**Target**: 30-40% (varies by project type)

### Materials Cost %
Materials as % of contract price

**Example**:
- Contract: $100,000
- Materials: $25,000
- Materials %: 25%

**Target**: 20-30%

### Job Efficiency
Estimated hours vs. actual hours

**Example**:
- Estimated: 400 hours
- Actual: 450 hours
- Efficiency: 89% (over budget)

Track to improve estimates.

## Accounting Challenges

### 1. Progress Billing (Percentage of Completion)

Don't wait until job completion to recognize revenue.

**Example**:
- $100,000 contract, 12-month duration
- After 3 months, 25% complete
- Record $25,000 revenue (proportional)
- Record $18,750 costs (proportional)
- Report $6,250 profit

Accrual accounting requires this.

### 2. Contract Costs Tracking

Must separate:
- Direct costs (materials, labor, equipment for this job)
- Indirect costs (office, admin, overhead)

Only direct costs reduce revenue for profitability calculation.

### 3. Retainage/Holdback

Customer often withholds final 5-10% until project completion.

**Example**:
- Contract: $100,000
- Payment schedule: 50% down, 45% at 50% completion, 5% final
- At 50% completion: Owed $50k, received only $50k + $45k = $95k
- $5k is retainage (held until completion)

Cash flow timing is critical.

### 4. Change Orders

Scope changes = additional revenue

**Example**:
- Original contract: $100,000
- Change order 1: +$5,000 (additional materials)
- Change order 2: +$3,000 (extra labor)
- New contract total: $108,000

Must document and track all changes.

## Unique Construction Deductions

- **Depreciation** (equipment, vehicles, tools)
- **Workers' compensation insurance** (major expense)
- **Equipment rental** (if renting vs. owning)
- **Subcontractor payments** (1099 contractors)
- **Materials and supplies**
- **Vehicle expenses** (mileage, fuel, maintenance)
- **Job site utilities** (temporary power, water)
- **Safety equipment** (harnesses, helmets, etc.)
- **Bonding costs** (bid bonds, performance bonds)
- **Licensing and permits**
- **Training** (OSHA, equipment operation)

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Not Tracking Retainage Separately
Retainage is owed but not received. Can't spend money you don't have.

### ❌ Scope Creep Without Change Orders
"Just do this too" without pricing = profit destruction.

### ❌ Underestimating Jobs
Poor estimation = negative margin. Get better at estimation or lose money.

### ❌ Not Tracking Labor Hours by Job
Can't calculate profit without knowing real hours spent per job.

### ❌ Mixing Equipment Costs
Personal equipment vs. job-specific creates deduction problems.

## Financial Management

**Critical During Project**:
- Labor hours tracked daily (by worker, by job)
- Materials invoiced and tracked
- Subcontractor payments
- Change orders documented

**Monthly**:
- Job profitability by project
- Labor efficiency (estimated vs. actual)
- Gross margin by job type
- Retainage tracking
- Equipment utilization

**Project Completion**:
- Final job profitability
- Lessons learned (actual vs. estimated)
- Change order effectiveness
- Customer satisfaction (impacts future work)

## When to Hire Help

**Bookkeeper**: $400-800/month
- Job cost tracking
- Progress billing
- Labor hours allocation
- Retainage tracking
- Monthly job profitability

**Construction Accountant**: $2,000-4,000/year
- Job costing optimization
- Tax planning
- Equipment depreciation
- Subcontractor management
- Financial forecasting by project type

## Construction Financial Wisdom

**Most contractors underestimate projects or lose money to scope creep.**

Better to overestimate and finish under budget (customer happy) than underestimate and lose money.

Track every job's profitability. Unprofitable jobs teach you to estimate better next time.
