## Key Metrics

### Conversion Rate
% of prospects who become clients

**Example**:
- Sales calls: 10
- Clients signed: 3
- Conversion: 30%

**Benchmark**: 20-30% is good for 1-on-1

### Cost Per Acquisition
Marketing spend ÷ New clients

**Example**:
- Monthly marketing: $2,000
- New clients: 5
- CPA: $400/client

Is this good? Depends on client lifetime value.

### Client Lifetime Value
Total revenue from client over relationship

**1-on-1 Example**:
- Monthly retainer: $500
- Average client duration: 6 months
- CLV: $3,000
- If CPA was $400, ROI is excellent

### Course Enrollment & Completion
Courses only successful if people complete

**Metric**: Completion rate (should be 40-60%)

Low completion = poor course design or too expensive price.

## Accounting Challenges

### 1. Deferred Revenue (Prepaid Programs)

Customer pays upfront, you deliver over time:

**Example**:
- 12-week program, $3,000
- Customer pays Jan 1
- Record as liability
- Recognize $250/week revenue as delivered
- After 12 weeks, fully recognized

Don't record as revenue day 1.

### 2. Cancellation/Refunds

Especially problematic in coaching:

**Example**:
- Sell 5 spots in group program @ $500 = $2,500 revenue
- 1 customer cancels, 1 goes to week 3
- Actual revenue only $2,000
- Refunds reduce revenue

Have clear refund policies.

### 3. Multiple Revenue Streams

Many coaches have multiple models:
- 1-on-1 coaching: 40% of revenue
- Group programs: 30%
- Courses: 20%
- Products: 10%

Track separately. Different margins, acquisition costs, conversion rates.

### 4. Sub-Contractors/Affiliates

Many coaches partner with others:
- Subcontractor coaching for your clients (pay commission)
- Affiliate courses (earn commission)
- Partnership programs

Must track and account for properly.

## Coaching Financial Wisdom

**Most successful coaches realize**: **Leverage beats time**

1-on-1 at $500/hour = $10k/month (20 hours)
Group of 10 at $250 = $2,500/person = $25k/month (2 hours)

As you scale, reduce 1-on-1, grow groups and courses.
