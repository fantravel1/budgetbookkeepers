# Food & Beverage: Accounting Guide for Restaurants, Cafes & Catering

## Industry Overview

Food & beverage is a high-volume, thin-margin business:
- **Typical margins**: 5-15% (compared to 30-40% for services)
- **High fixed costs**: Rent, labor (30-35% of revenue typical)
- **Inventory challenges**: Perishable goods, spoilage losses
- **Complex labor**: Tipping, shift management
- **Tight cash flow**: Daily operations need consistent cash

## Critical Metrics

### Food Cost Percentage
Food costs as % of revenue (target: 28-35%)

**Calculation**:
- Beginning inventory: $5,000
- + Purchases: $8,000
- - Ending inventory: $4,000
- = Food used: $9,000
- Revenue: $30,000
- Food cost %: 30% ✓ (target)

**Too high?** Check: Portion sizes, waste, theft, pricing

### Labor Cost Percentage
Labor (including payroll taxes, benefits) as % of revenue

**Calculation**:
- Payroll + taxes/benefits: $10,000
- Revenue: $30,000
- Labor %: 33% ✓ (target: 28-35%)

High-end restaurants target lower %. Quick service targets higher.

### Prime Cost
Food cost % + Labor cost % (two biggest expenses)

**Target**: 60-65% of revenue

Above 65%? Business isn't viable at current prices/volume.

### Daily/Weekly Sales Mix
Which items sell most (and most profitably)?

**Example**:
- Coffee: 40% of revenue, 80% margin
- Pastries: 30% of revenue, 65% margin
- Lunch sandwiches: 30% of revenue, 35% margin

Focus on high-margin items (upselling coffee/pastries).

## Accounting Challenges

### 1. Inventory Management (Perishable)

Track inventory daily/weekly:
- Items expire (write off as waste)
- Spoilage must be documented
- Supplier freshness/quality
- Par levels (how much to keep on hand)

**Monthly P&L adjustment**:
- COGS includes spoilage losses
- Track waste separately to identify problems

### 2. Tip Tracking (Varies by Country)

**USA Context**:
- Employee tips are their income (not business income)
- But employee tips reduce employer tax burden sometimes
- Track tips for labor law compliance
- Cash tips create reconciliation challenges

**Accounting**:
- Tips paid by card: Easy to track
- Cash tips: More difficult, use point-of-sale estimates

### 3. Alcohol Licensing & Tracking

Alcoholic beverages have special accounting:
- Higher margin (40-50%)
- Separate inventory tracking required
- Licensing fees/compliance costs
- Age verification liability

Track separately (high profit item!).

### 4. Daily Cash Reconciliation

Cash-heavy business means daily reconciliation essential:
- POS system vs. actual cash
- Discrepancies must be investigated immediately
- Shrinkage (theft) must be tracked

### 5. Meal Component Accounting

Menu items use multiple components:

**Example - Caesar Salad**:
- Lettuce: $1.00
- Dressing: $0.50
- Croutons: $0.50
- Parmesan: $0.50
- Labor: $1.00
- Total cost: $3.50
- Price: $12
- Margin: 71% (but seems high with labor)

Accurate recipe costing is essential.

## Common F&B Mistakes

### ❌ Not Tracking Food Costs
Biggest margin killer. Without accurate food cost %, can't know if profitable.

### ❌ Ignoring Waste/Spoilage
Waste adds up fast. Track daily, investigate high waste.

### ❌ Not Menu Engineering
Selling low-margin items. Identify high-profit items and promote.

### ❌ Improper Tip Accounting
Tip handling mistakes create compliance and reconciliation issues.

### ❌ Not Controlling Labor
Staffing beyond needs kills margin. Forecast demand, schedule accordingly.

## F&B Financial Wisdom

**Most restaurants fail due to one reason**: **Ignoring prime cost (food + labor %)**

If prime cost exceeds 65%, you can't profit even with perfect execution elsewhere.

Before opening, model out: Food cost % + Expected labor % = Feasibility
