# Fitness & Wellness: Membership & Class Accounting

## Industry Overview

Fitness and wellness businesses (gyms, studios, spas) have characteristics:
- **Membership model** (recurring revenue)
- **Class-based** (capacity-constrained)
- **High fixed costs** (equipment, facilities)
- **Churn-heavy** (member retention critical)
- **Personal training** (additional revenue stream)
- **Retail products** (supplements, gear)
- **Seasonal membership** (New Year's peak)

---

## Critical Metrics

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
Total membership fees per month

**Example**:
- Basic members: 200 × $50 = $10,000
- Premium members: 100 × $100 = $10,000
- Personal training (monthly): 50 × $200 = $10,000
- Total MRR: $30,000

**Target**: 80%+ of total revenue from MRR

### Churn Rate
% of members canceling per month

**Example**:
- Starting members: 300
- Canceled: 30
- Churn: 10%/month
- Annual: Members gone in ~10 months (unsustainable)

**Target**: <5% monthly (critical metric)

### Member Lifetime Value
Average revenue from member × Tenure

**Example**:
- Average membership: $75/month
- Average tenure: 12 months
- LTV: $900

**Cost**: If CAC (customer acquisition cost) is $200, ROI is 4.5x (excellent).

### Cost per Member Acquisition (CAC)
Total marketing spend ÷ New members

**Example**:
- Monthly marketing: $5,000
- New members: 50
- CAC: $100/member

### Capacity Utilization
Members using facilities ÷ Capacity

**Example**:
- Peak hours: 40 people, capacity 60 (67% utilization)
- Off-peak hours: 5 people, capacity 60 (8% utilization)

Uneven utilization = underutilized facility.

## Revenue Streams

### 1. Memberships (Foundation)
- Basic tier: $40-80/month
- Premium tier: $80-150/month
- Annual membership: Often discounted

### 2. Personal Training
- $50-150/session (varies by coach)
- Package of 10: Higher margin

### 3. Class Add-ons
- Specialty classes: Yoga, spinning, CrossFit
- Premium location classes: Peak hours command premium

### 4. Retail Products
- Supplements, apparel, equipment
- 20-50% margin typically

### 5. Services
- Nutrition coaching, body composition analysis, massage

## Accounting Challenges

### 1. Deferred Revenue (Prepaid Memberships)

Members pay upfront:

**Example**:
- Member pays $600 annual ($50/month × 12)
- Record as liability: Deferred revenue $600
- Recognize $50/month as revenue as delivered
- By end of year: $0 deferred, $600 total revenue

### 2. Member Refunds

Members cancel mid-year:

**Example**:
- Paid $600 annual upfront
- Cancelled after 6 months
- Refund: $300 (50%)
- Reduce deferred revenue by $300

### 3. Personal Training Revenue

Often package-based (prepaid):

**Example**:
- Customer buys 10 sessions for $1,000
- Record as liability: $1,000
- Each session: Move $100 to revenue
- After 10 sessions: Fully earned

### 4. Retail Inventory

Track separately from membership:

**Example**:
- Supplement sales: $5,000 (50% margin)
- Apparel sales: $3,000 (40% margin)
- Profit from retail: $3,400

## Unique Wellness Deductions

- **Equipment depreciation** (treadmills, weights, bikes)
- **Facility rent**
- **Equipment maintenance** (repairs, servicing)
- **Software** (membership management, class scheduling)
- **Insurance** (liability, property)
- **Cleaning and sanitation**
- **Utilities**
- **Staff training** (certifications, CPR, etc.)
- **Marketing** (digital, memberships)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Ignoring Churn
Churn of 10%/month means business dies in ~10 months.

### ❌ Not Tracking Member Lifetime Value
Don't know real value of customer. Can't optimize CAC spend.

### ❌ High CAC Relative to LTV
If CAC is $200 and LTV is $300, margin is thin (only $100 lifetime profit per member).

### ❌ Ignoring Class Capacity
Peak hours packed, off-hours empty = pricing mismatch.

### ❌ Not Managing Seasonal Peaks
January surge will overwhelm if not planned (staffing, equipment, capacity).

## Financial Management

**Critical Daily**:
- Member check-ins (usage tracking)
- Cash/card payments

**Weekly**:
- New member sign-ups
- Cancellation requests
- Class attendance

**Monthly**:
- MRR (members × fees)
- Churn rate
- Member LTV
- Retail revenue
- Personal training revenue
- Profitability by revenue stream

**Quarterly**:
- Churn trend
- Pricing strategy review (seasonal adjustments?)
- Member satisfaction
- Retention campaigns

---

## Retention Strategies (Financial Impact)

**Challenge**: Member retention is everything.

**Cost of acquisition**: $100/member (approximate)
**Cost to retain**: 10-20% of acquisition cost
**Revenue per member**: $50-100/month

**Math**: Retain one member from Jan to Dec = $600-1,200 revenue (vs. $100 to acquire).

Focus on retention (cheapest growth).

**Accountant**: $1,000-2,000/year
- Tax optimization for membership revenue
- Seasonal planning
- Pricing strategy

## Fitness Industry Financial Wisdom

**Your best customer is the one you already have.**

Retention costs 1/10 of acquisition. If you're paying $100 to acquire members but losing 10%/month, you're in trouble.

Build retention culture first, growth second.
