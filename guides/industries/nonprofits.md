# Nonprofits: Financial Management & Compliance Guide

## Industry Overview

Nonprofits have unique financial requirements:
- **Tax-exempt** (but only if properly filed and maintained)
- **Donor reporting** (transparency required)
- **Grant accounting** (restricted vs. unrestricted)
- **Compliance heavy** (Form 990, audit requirements)
- **No profit motive** (surplus funds reinvested)

---

## Critical Differences from For-Profit

### Fund Accounting
Nonprofits track money by fund:
- **Unrestricted**: Donor says "use however you need"
- **Restricted**: Donor specifies how money must be used
- **Temporarily restricted**: Time-limited or purpose-limited

**Example**:
- Unrestricted donations: $50,000 (can use anywhere)
- Grant for youth program: $30,000 (must use only for youth program)
- Endowment gift**: $100,000 (fund value preserved, only earn on interest)

**Accounting**: Track separately. Required for reporting.

### Form 990 Filing

Mandatory annual filing (like tax return for nonprofits):
- **990-N**: E-postcard (>$50k revenue)
- **990-EZ**: Simple form ($50k-$200k revenue)
- **990**: Full form (>$200k revenue or complex structure)

Public document (anyone can view online). Required for tax-exempt status.

### Audit Requirements

Many funders/donors require annual audit:
- CPA performs detailed financial review
- "Clean" audit = no problems found
- "Qualified" audit = minor issues
- "Disclaimer" audit = major issues

Cost: $3,000-15,000+ depending on complexity.

## Key Nonprofit Metrics

### Fundraising Efficiency
How much does fundraising cost vs. revenue raised?

**Calculation**:
- Fundraising costs: $20,000
- Donation revenue: $200,000
- Efficiency: 10% (excellent)

**Benchmark**: 10-15% is healthy. Over 25% is problematic.

### Program Ratio
What % of revenue goes to actual mission vs. overhead?

**Calculation**:
- Program expenses: $400,000
- Admin/fundraising: $100,000
- Total: $500,000
- Program ratio: 80% (excellent)

**Benchmark**: 75%+ to programs is healthy. Donors/funders want to see this.

### Donor Retention Rate
% of donors who give again next year

**Example**:
- Donors this year: 500
- Donors who gave last year and gave again: 300
- Retention: 60%

Low retention = constant new donor search. High retention = sustainable funding.

### Grant Funding vs. Individual Donations
Diversified funding is more stable.

**Example**:
- Grants: 40% of revenue (one grant loss = problem)
- Individual donations: 50%
- Other (program revenue, events): 10%

Better balance = less risk.

## Accounting Challenges

### 1. Grant Accounting (Restricted Funds)

Grants come with restrictions. Must track separately and use as specified.

**Example**:
- Grant: $50,000 for "homeless shelter construction"
- Can use ONLY for homeless shelter
- Cannot use for admin, even if needed
- Must document spending and report to grantor

Failure = loss of future grants, legal issues.

### 2. In-Kind Donations (Non-Cash)

Donations of goods/services must be valued and recorded.

**Example**:
- Donated office supplies: $5,000 (value at cost to donor)
- Volunteer labor: 200 hours × $25/hour = $5,000 (value at market rate)
- Donated building use: $12,000/year (market rent value)

Must estimate value (conservative approach better).

### 3. Donor Restrictions & Endowments

- **Temporarily Restricted**: Can use after deadline or when condition met
- **Permanently Restricted** (endowment): Never spend principal, only earnings

Example:
- Donor: "Use $50k for youth program after 2025"
- 2024: Record as temporarily restricted
- 2026: Reclassify to unrestricted, can now use

## Unique Nonprofit Deductions

All normal business deductions apply, PLUS:
- **Grant-seeking costs** (writing proposals)
- **Fundraising events** (costs to raise money)
- **Volunteer recruitment** (advertising for volunteers)
- **Training for volunteers/staff** (mission-related)
- **Donor recognition** (events, plaques)

## Common Nonprofit Mistakes

### ❌ Not Tracking Grant Restrictions
Using grant money for unapproved purposes = repayment required + reputation damage.

### ❌ Ignoring Form 990 Requirements
Late filing can cost tax-exempt status. Intentional misreporting = criminal.

### ❌ Not Separating Finances
Personal and nonprofit expenses mixed = audit problems + credibility loss.

### ❌ Not Valuing In-Kind Donations
Undervaluing donations overstates efficiency ratio and misrepresents impact.

### ❌ Weak Financial Controls
No segregation of duties = embezzlement risk. Common in small nonprofits.

---

## Financial Controls (Essential)

- **Two-person approval** for expenses over threshold
- **Monthly reconciliation** (treasurer reviews)
- **Annual audit** (if required by bylaws/grants)
- **Conflict of interest policy** (documented)
- **Budget vs. actual review** (quarterly)
- **Cash restricted** (not spent without approval)

---

## 501(c)(3) Maintenance

Tax-exempt status requires:
- Annual Form 990 filing (on time)
- Board governance (regular meetings, minutes)
- No private inurement (no excessive salaries)
- Reasonable compensation (board salaries must be market)
- Public disclosure (Form 990 available to public)
- Annual Form 1023-N e-postcard (if under $50k)

## Sample Nonprofit Dashboard

Monthly tracking:
- Revenue (grants, donations, program revenue)
- Expenses (by program, admin, fundraising)
- Program ratio %
- Fundraising efficiency %
- Restricted vs. unrestricted balance
- Grant status (awarded, pending, deadline)
- Donor count

## Nonprofit Financial Wisdom

**Biggest nonprofit problem**: **Spending all unrestricted funds, leaving nothing for operations**

Healthy nonprofits keep 6-12 months operating reserve. This allows mission continuation if funding dips.
