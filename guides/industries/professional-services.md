# Professional Services (Consulting, Legal, Accounting): Guide

## Industry Overview

Professional services (consulting, law, accounting, engineering, design) share characteristics:
- **Expertise-based pricing** (expertise commands premium)
- **Billable hours model** (time = money)
- **High margins** (50-70% common)
- **Client relationships** (retention critical)
- **Knowledge workers** (staff is your product)
- **Client concentration risk** (few large clients = risky)

## Critical Metrics

### Billable Utilization Rate
Hours billed ÷ Total hours available

**Example**:
- Total hours/week: 40
- Billable hours: 30
- Utilization: 75%

**Target**: 70-80% (need time for admin, business development, learning)

### Effective Hourly Rate
Total revenue ÷ Total hours worked

**Example**:
- Revenue: $200,000
- Hours worked: 2,000
- Effective rate: $100/hour (vs. card rate of $150/hour)

Card rate vs. effective rate shows true profitability.

### Realization Rate
Actual revenue ÷ Potential revenue (if all hours billed)

**Example**:
- Billable hours: 2,000
- Billed at $150/hour: $300,000 potential
- Actual revenue: $240,000 (some discounts, writeoffs)
- Realization: 80%

High realization = strong pricing discipline.

### Client Concentration
% of revenue from top clients

**Example**:
- Top client: $80,000 (40% of revenue)
- Top 3 clients: $150,000 (75% of revenue)

Dangerous if >50% from one client (risk of losing them).

## Business Models

### Hourly Billing
- Bill by hour worked
- $150-300+/hour typical
- Incentivizes working fast (bad)
- Easy to implement

### Monthly Retainer
- Fixed fee per month
- $3,000-10,000+/month typical
- Predictable revenue
- Better for both sides

### Project/Fixed Price
- Quote for specific project
- Better margin if efficient
- Risk if underestimated
- Aligns incentives

### Hybrid
- Retainer + project work
- Most sustainable
- Retainer = predictable, projects = growth

## Accounting Challenges

### 1. Unbilled Hours
Work completed but not yet invoiced.

**Example**:
- Complete 20 hours of work in March
- Invoice in April
- Accrue revenue in March (accrual accounting)
- Record as "unbilled revenue" asset

### 2. Client Discounts & Writeoffs
Discounting work kills margin:

**Example**:
- Worked 100 hours @ $150/hour = $15,000
- Client says "too high, can you reduce by 20%?"
- Revenue: $12,000
- Realization: 80%

Track discounts separately to identify patterns.

### 3. Overhead Allocation
How much does it cost to support each billable hour?

**Example**:
- Total staff costs: $500,000
- Total billable hours: 4,000
- Overhead per hour: $125
- If billing at $200/hour: Real profit only $75/hour

## Unique Professional Services Deductions

- **Professional development** (courses, certifications, conferences)
- **Licensing fees** (bar association, professional licenses)
- **Malpractice/liability insurance** (varies by profession)
- **Office setup** (professional appearance)
- **Technology** (software, tools, databases)
- **Professional memberships** (associations, societies)
- **Client entertainment** (mostly non-deductible now)
- **Research materials** (publications, databases)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Low Utilization Rates
If you're only billing 50% of hours, you're losing money on overhead.

### ❌ Excessive Discounting
Discounts compound. 10% discount to 10 clients = 10% overall margin reduction.

### ❌ Client Concentration
Losing one big client can tank the business.

### ❌ Not Raising Rates
Should increase 5-10% annually. Market inflation is real.

### ❌ Scope Creep Without Billing
"Can you also..." without pricing kills profit.

## Professional Services Financial Wisdom

**Your real hourly rate is effective rate, not card rate.**

If you bill at $200/hour but effective rate is $100/hour, your business model is broken.
