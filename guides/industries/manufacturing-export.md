# Manufacturing & Export: Financial Management Guide

## Industry Overview

Manufacturing has unique financial characteristics:
- **Capital intensive** (equipment investment large)
- **Inventory complex** (raw materials, WIP, finished goods)
- **Quality control costs** (testing, compliance)
- **Supply chain** (supplier management critical)
- **Export complexity** (multiple currencies, regulations)
- **Longer cycles** (procurement to delivery is months)

---

## Critical Challenges

### 1. Multiple Inventory Levels

**Raw Materials**: Purchased materials not yet in production
**Work in Progress (WIP)**: Partially completed products
**Finished Goods**: Completed products ready to sell

**Monthly Calculation**:
- Beginning inventory: $100,000
- Purchases: $50,000
- Ending inventory: $120,000
- COGS: $30,000

Each level must be tracked and valued separately.

### 2. Cost Allocation

Which costs go into product cost vs. period expense?

**Into Product Cost (COGS)**:
- Raw materials
- Direct labor (wages of production workers)
- Manufacturing overhead (facility, utilities, equipment depreciation)

**Period Expenses** (don't go in COGS):
- Sales commissions
- Marketing
- Office staff salaries
- Admin costs

Wrong allocation = wrong profit calculation.

### 3. Capital Equipment Depreciation

Manufacturing equipment is major asset:

**Example - $500,000 Machine**:
- Useful life: 10 years
- Annual depreciation: $50,000
- This is annual expense reducing profit
- After 10 years: $0 book value

Track depreciation method consistently (straight-line typical).

### 4. Quality Control & Waste

Manufacturing produces defects, waste, scrap:

**Accounting**:
- Normal waste: Included in COGS
- Abnormal waste: Recorded separately (identifies problems)
- Scrap value: Reduces COGS

**Example**:
- 1000 units produced
- 50 defects (5% = normal)
- Included in COGS
- If 15% defects (abnormal), flag and investigate

## Export-Specific Accounting

### Multi-Currency Management

**Challenge**: Sales in multiple currencies, costs in others

**Example**:
- Sales in USD: $100,000 (cost basis)
- Costs in EUR: €50,000 (changes in value daily)
- Exchange rate: $1 = €0.95
- EUR cost in USD: €50,000 ÷ 0.95 = $52,632

Exchange rate changes create gain/loss.

**Solution**: Hedge currency risk or accept volatility.

### Export Compliance Costs

**Deductible Expenses**:
- Documentation (invoices, customs forms)
- Certification/compliance
- Tariff/duty analysis
- Trade agreement documentation
- Export insurance

### Transfer Pricing (Multi-Country Operations)

If you have operations in multiple countries:
- Price charged between divisions must be documented
- Can't artificially inflate costs in high-tax country
- Regulations strict (tax authorities scrutinize)
- Requires professional help

## Key Manufacturing Metrics

### Gross Margin
(Revenue - COGS) ÷ Revenue

**Target**: 30-50% depending on product complexity

### Operating Margin
(Gross Profit - Operating Expenses) ÷ Revenue

**Target**: 10-20%

### Inventory Turnover
COGS ÷ Average inventory

**Target**: 4-6x per year (inventory sits 2-3 months)

### Production Efficiency
Actual output ÷ Expected output (for same cost)

**Target**: 90%+ (identify inefficiencies at <90%)

### Lead Time
Time from order to delivery (affects cash flow)

**Example**:
- Customer orders day 1
- Production: 30 days
- Quality check: 5 days
- Shipping: 20 days
- Total: 55 days (you're in working capital hole for 55 days)

## Unique Deductions

- **Equipment depreciation** (major expense)
- **Factory utilities** (significant)
- **Quality testing** (compliance, safety)
- **Scrap & waste** (if normal level)
- **Supply chain management** (software, staff)
- **Trade compliance** (documentation, certification)
- **Export insurance**
- **Tariff analysis** (minimizing costs)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Not Tracking Inventory Properly
Inventory changes affect profit significantly. Poor tracking = wrong numbers.

### ❌ Miscalculating COGS
Allocating costs wrong overstates profit dangerously.

### ❌ Ignoring Quality Control Costs
Defect rates kill margin if not addressed.

### ❌ Not Managing Exchange Rate Risk
Currency swings can wipe out profits on exports.

### ❌ Ignoring Export Compliance Costs
Undercounting costs on export contracts makes them unprofitable.

## Manufacturing Financial Wisdom

**Most manufacturers get surprised by**: **Working capital requirements**

Growing revenue 50% requires 50% more cash tied up in inventory and receivables.

Plan for this. Negotiate supplier terms and customer payment terms accordingly.
