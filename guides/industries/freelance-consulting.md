# Freelance & Consulting Services: Financial Management Guide

## Industry Overview

Freelance/consulting has unique characteristics:
- **Time-based pricing** (hourly/daily rates)
- **Limited capacity** (can only work so many hours)
- **Highly scalable income potential** (raise rates, not hours)
- **Minimal overhead** (often home-based)
- **Inconsistent cash flow** (clients don't pay immediately)
- **Multiple clients** (diversified revenue)

## Critical Metrics

### Effective Hourly Rate
What you actually earn per hour (not your rate card)

**Calculation**:
- Total billable hours: 1,000/year
- Actual worked hours: 1,500/year (includes admin, proposal writing)
- Revenue: $100,000
- Effective hourly rate: $100,000 ÷ 1,500 = $66.67/hour

Your card rate is $100/hour, but you only earn $66.67 effective.

### Billable Rate
What you charge per hour

**Benchmark**:
- Entry level: $25-50/hour
- Mid-level: $50-150/hour
- Expert: $150-300+/hour
- Specialized expert: $300-500+/hour

Rate depends on specialization, demand, location, experience.

### Utilization Rate
Billable hours as % of total hours

**Calculation**:
- Billable hours: 1,000
- Total hours available (1,500 for 30 hours/week × 50 weeks): 1,500
- Utilization: 67%

**Target**: 70-80% (need 20-30% for admin, marketing, admin stuff)

### Revenue per Client
Track which clients are most profitable

**Example**:
- Client A: $50,000/year (10 clients × $5,000 average)
- Client B: $20,000/year (high volume)
- Client C: $35,000/year (best client)

Focus on top clients, develop relationships.

## Accounting Challenges

### 1. Unbilled Work

Work that hasn't been invoiced yet:

**Example**:
- Complete 20 hours work in March ($2,000 value)
- Invoice in April
- Accrue the revenue in March (accrual accounting)
- Record as "unbilled revenue" asset

**Why**: Revenue recognition in correct period.

### 2. Client Aging/Receivables

Unlike retail where customer pays immediately:

**Example**:
- Finish work Jan 31, invoice Feb 1
- Client pays March 1 (30 days)
- High DSO (days sales outstanding)

Follow-up on slow payers aggressively.

### 3. Retainer Clients

Monthly prepaid retainers:

**Accounting**:
- Customer pays $5,000 retainer on Jan 1
- Record as liability (deferred revenue)
- As you work, move $1,667/month to revenue
- By April 1, completely earned

## Unique Freelance Deductions

- **Home office** (significant in freelance)
- **Professional education** (courses, books, certifications)
- **Subscriptions** (software, tools, memberships)
- **Travel** (client meetings, conferences)
- **Meals & entertainment** (client meals often 50% deductible)
- **Equipment** (computer, desk, software)
- **Marketing** (website, cards, advertising)
- **Insurance** (liability coverage if applicable)
- **Coworking space** (if not home-based)

## Pricing Strategies

### Time-Based (Hourly/Daily Rates)
- Simple to implement
- Doesn't scale (limited hours)
- Encourages efficiency (bad for you)
- Easy to compare to competitors

### Project-Based Pricing
- Estimate hours needed × hourly rate + margin
- Better margin if you're efficient
- Better for client (fixed cost)
- Must estimate accurately

### Value-Based Pricing
- Based on value to client, not your time
- Highest profit potential
- Hardest to implement
- Best for experienced professionals

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Underpricing Services
Most freelancers charge too little. Raising rates 10-20% often costs 0-1 clients but increases profit 40-50%.

### ❌ Not Tracking Billable vs. Non-Billable Time
Can't calculate true effective rate without this.

### ❌ Scope Creep
Client asks for "just a little more" and you do it unbilled. Sets bad precedent.

### ❌ Not Following Up on Unpaid Invoices
Clients pay when reminded. Follow up after 10 days, 20 days, 30 days.

### ❌ Relying on Few Clients
If 50% of revenue from one client, that's risk. Diversify.

## Freelance Financial Wisdom

**The lever that transforms your business**: **Raising your rates**

At $50/hour × 1,000 hours = $50,000
Raise to $75/hour × 900 hours (lose a few clients) = $67,500 (35% increase)

Rate increases compound over time. What matters most: Specialization and value delivery.
