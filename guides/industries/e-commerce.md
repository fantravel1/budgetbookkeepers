# E-Commerce & Online Retail: Complete Accounting Guide

## Industry Overview

E-commerce is the fastest-growing retail sector, but it's financially complex. Every marketplace (Amazon, Etsy, Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.) takes a cut, which dramatically reduces actual profit compared to gross revenue.

**Key Challenge**: Gross revenue looks impressive ($100k sales), but net profit is much lower after marketplace fees (15-30%), payment processing (2-3%), shipping costs (5-15%), and product cost (20-50%).

## Critical Accounting Challenges

### 1. Multi-Channel Revenue Tracking

Most e-commerce businesses sell on multiple platforms:
- Direct website (Shopify, WooCommerce)
- Amazon
- Ebay
- Etsy
- Facebook Shop
- TikTok Shop

**Accounting Solution**:
- Create separate income category for each channel
- Reconcile weekly (inventory and revenue)
- Track where customers come from

**Example**:
- Website Sales: $30,000 (30% of sales, 40% of profit)
- Amazon Sales: $40,000 (40% of sales, 35% of profit)
- Etsy Sales: $20,000 (20% of sales, 20% of profit)

**Insight**: Website is lower revenue but highest margin (no marketplace cuts).

### 2. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Calculation

This is where most e-commerce businesses make mistakes.

**True COGS includes**:
- Product cost
- Inbound shipping
- Packaging materials
- Outbound shipping (reflected in margin)
- Returns/refunds

**Example**:
- Sale price: $50
- Marketplace fee: -$15 (30%)
- Payment fee: -$1.50
- Product cost: -$15
- Packaging: -$2
- Inbound shipping: -$1
- **Actual profit: $15.50 (31% margin, not 50%)**

### 3. Inventory Management

**Monthly Calculation**:
- Beginning inventory: $10,000
- + Purchases: $25,000
- - Ending inventory: $12,000
- = COGS: $23,000

Count inventory monthly and value using FIFO or weighted average method.

### 4. Returns & Refunds

Returns kill profitability if not tracked.

**Impact**:
- 5% return rate: 42.5% margin (vs. 50% without returns)
- 10% return rate: 35% margin

Monitor return rates by product. High returns indicate quality or fulfillment issues.

## Key Metrics for E-Commerce

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
Marketing spend ÷ New customers

Example: $5,000 ads ÷ 500 customers = $10 CAC

**Is it good?** If average customer lifetime value is $100+ = good ROI.

### Profit Margin by Product
Track each SKU's margin. Eliminate products under 10% margin unless strategic.

### Inventory Turnover
COGS ÷ Average inventory

Example: $200,000 COGS ÷ $20,000 inventory = 10x per year (good)

### Return Rate
Target: <5% (excellent), <10% (acceptable)

## Unique E-Commerce Deductions

- **Marketplace fees** (Amazon, Etsy, etc.)
- **Shipping supplies** (boxes, packaging)
- **Inventory losses** (damaged/obsolete)
- **Platform subscriptions** (Shopify, WooCommerce hosting)
- **Product photography** (models, props, photographer fees)
- **Returns processing** (return shipping you pay)
- **Warehouse storage** (if not home-based)

## Common E-Commerce Mistakes

### ❌ Confusing Gross Revenue with Profit
$100k sales ≠ $100k profit. Calculate actual margin after all fees.

### ❌ Not Tracking Inventory Properly
Inflated inventory hides profitability problems.

### ❌ Ignoring Customer Acquisition Cost
Spending $100 to get a $50 customer = losing money.

### ❌ Not Accounting for Returns
Returns destroy profit if not properly calculated.

### ❌ Mixing Personal and Business Inventory
Can't tell what's for business vs. personal use.

## Financial Management Timeline

**Pre-Launch**: Calculate unit economics, inventory investment needed, 6+ months operating costs

**Year 1**: Daily inventory tracking, weekly profit analysis, monthly CAC analysis

**Year 2+**: Multi-channel analysis, scaling high-margin products, eliminating low-margin items

**Year 3+**: FBA/3PL analysis, private label strategy, international expansion

## When to Hire Help

**Bookkeeper**: When revenue >$50k or multiple marketplaces ($300-700/month)

**Accountant**: When revenue >$150k or multiple state/international sales ($500-2,000/year)

---

## Final Wisdom

**Biggest mistake**: Celebrating revenue without knowing profit.

$1M sales at 20% margin = $200k profit.
$1M sales at 10% margin = $100k profit.

Know your unit economics before scaling. Every $1 of growth should maintain or improve profitability.
