# Healthcare & Medical Practices: Accounting & Compliance Guide

## Industry Overview

Healthcare practices are heavily regulated with complex billing:
- **Insurance billing** (Medicare, private insurance, self-pay mix)
- **HIPAA compliance** (privacy rules affect accounting systems)
- **Licensing requirements** (professional compliance)
- **Complex receivables** (insurance denials, appeals)
- **High liability** (malpractice insurance significant expense)
- **Deferred revenue** (patient prepayments, insurance deposits)

## Critical Challenges

### 1. Accounts Receivable (Insurance & Patient)

Unlike typical business where customer pays immediately, healthcare has complex receivables:

**Timeline**:
- Day 1: Service provided ($500)
- Day 5: Claim submitted to insurance
- Day 30: Insurance payment arrives ($350)
- Remaining: Patient responsible ($150)
- Days 60-90: Collect from patient (many never pay)

**Accounting Issue**: Revenue is $500 on day 1 (accrual), but cash comes day 30+ and may never come fully.

**Write-offs**: Track uncollectible amounts separately.

### 2. Insurance Verification & Billing

**Revenue Depends On**:
- Correct insurance information
- Coverage verification (is procedure covered?)
- Prior authorization (approval before procedure)
- Coding (correct diagnosis/procedure codes = proper payment)

**Accounting Challenge**: Don't know actual revenue until insurance determines coverage/payment.

### 3. Patient Payment Responsibility

Patients often don't understand what they'll owe:

**Example**:
- Insurance covers 80%
- Patient responsible for: deductible ($500) + 20% coinsurance
- Total patient responsibility: $500 + $100 = $600
- Many don't pay

Track and age patient receivables like business receivables.

### 4. Deferred Revenue (Prepaid Patients)

- Retainer patients pay upfront
- Monthly concierge fees pre-paid
- Insurance deposits held

Record as liability until service delivered.

## Healthcare-Specific Metrics

### Claims Denial Rate
% of submitted insurance claims denied or partially paid

**Target**: <5% (industry avg 10-15%)

High denial rate indicates:
- Billing code errors
- Missing documentation
- Insurance eligibility issues
- Opportunity to improve revenue

### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
Average days to collect payment

**Calculation**:
- Accounts receivable: $50,000
- Daily revenue: $2,000
- DSO: 25 days

**Target**: <30 days (varies by payer mix)

High DSO ties up cash.

### Patient Aging Report
How old are outstanding patient balances?

**Example**:
- 0-30 days: $10,000 (collectible)
- 31-60 days: $8,000 (likely collectible)
- 61-90 days: $5,000 (questionable)
- 90+ days: $3,000 (probably uncollectible)

Write off over 120 days.

### Operating Margin
(Revenue - Operating Costs) ÷ Revenue

**Target**: 15-25% (varies by practice type)

Medical practices have high fixed costs (facility, staff), so margin matters.

## Unique Healthcare Deductions

- **Malpractice insurance** (major expense)
- **Medical license/certification** (continuing education)
- **HIPAA compliance** (software, training)
- **Medical equipment** (depreciated)
- **Patient records systems** (EMR/EHR software)
- **Lab equipment** (if testing done in-house)
- **Sterilization equipment** (dental, surgical)
- **Professional liability insurance** (deductible)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Not Tracking Insurance vs. Patient Receivables
Can't tell if revenue issue is insurance or patient payment.

### ❌ Not Verifying Insurance Before Service
Providing service, finding after that it's not covered = lost revenue.

### ❌ Inaccurate Coding
Wrong diagnosis/procedure codes = insurance denial or underpayment.

### ❌ Not Following Up on Claims
Claims denied? Appeal rate could be 50%+ reversal. Worth pursuing.

### ❌ Ignoring Patient Payment Responsibility
Patients often don't pay. Send bills immediately, follow up aggressively.

## Healthcare Financial Wisdom

**Biggest revenue leak**: **Unpaid patient balances**

Aggressive patient payment collection is essential. Many practices leave 10-20% revenue on the table due to poor collections.
