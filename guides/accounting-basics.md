## The Fundamental Accounting Equation

Everything in accounting comes down to this simple equation:

```
ASSETS = LIABILITIES + OWNER'S EQUITY
```

### What This Means

**Assets** = Things your business owns (has value)
- Cash in bank
- Equipment
- Inventory
- Accounts receivable (money customers owe you)
- Investments

**Liabilities** = Things your business owes
- Business loans
- Credit card debt
- Accounts payable (money you owe suppliers)
- Tax liabilities

**Owner's Equity** = Your ownership stake
- Money you invested
- Retained profits
- Stock (if incorporated)

### Example: Sarah's Freelance Design Business

| **Assets** | | **Liabilities** | |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cash | $5,000 | Credit card debt | $2,000 |
| Laptop | $1,500 | Business loan | $5,000 |
| Furniture | $800 | Owed to contractors | $1,500 |
| **Total Assets** | **$7,300** | **Total Liabilities** | **$8,500** |

**Sarah's Equity** = $7,300 - $8,500 = **-$1,200** (She's underwater)

This means Sarah owes more than she owns. Not uncommon for startups, but important to know.

## The Three Financial Statements

### 1. Income Statement (Profit & Loss)
**What it shows**: Did you make money this period?

```
Revenue                    $50,000
- Expenses                 $18,000
= Profit (or Loss)         $32,000
```

**Why it matters**:
- Shows your actual profit, not guesses
- Identifies your most profitable services
- Shows where money is being spent
- Used for taxes, loans, investor decisions

**Real Example: Coffee Shop**
```
Coffee Sales              $40,000
Food Sales                $15,000
Other (merch, etc)         $5,000
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total Revenue             $60,000

Labor Costs               $18,000
Supplies & Inventory      $12,000
Rent                       $4,000
Utilities                    $800
Equipment & Maintenance     $600
Marketing                    $500
Insurance                  $1,200
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total Expenses            $37,100

Net Profit                $22,900
Profit Margin: 38.2%
```

**Key Insight**: Even though gross revenue is $60k, you only keep $22.9k. The 37.1k goes to running the business.

### 2. Balance Sheet
**What it shows**: What do you own and what do you owe right now?

Snapshot at a specific date (like Dec 31)

```
ASSETS (What You Own)
Current Assets (can use within 1 year):
- Cash                               $15,000
- Accounts Receivable (owed by customers) $8,000
- Inventory                          $5,000
Subtotal Current Assets              $28,000

Fixed Assets (long-term equipment):
- Equipment                          $20,000
- Less depreciation                 ($4,000)
Subtotal Fixed Assets                $16,000

TOTAL ASSETS                         $44,000

LIABILITIES (What You Owe)
Current Liabilities (due within 1 year):
- Credit Card Debt                   $5,000
- Accounts Payable                   $3,000
- Payroll Taxes Owed                 $2,000
Subtotal Current Liabilities         $10,000

Long-term Liabilities:
- Business Loan                      $15,000
TOTAL LIABILITIES                    $25,000

OWNER'S EQUITY
- Owner Investment                   $10,000
- Retained Earnings                   $9,000
TOTAL EQUITY                         $19,000

TOTAL LIABILITIES + EQUITY           $44,000
```

**The equation holds**: Assets ($44k) = Liabilities ($25k) + Equity ($19k)

### 3. Cash Flow Statement
**What it shows**: Where did your cash actually go?

This is different from profit! You can be profitable but run out of cash.

```
Starting Cash (Jan 1)        $10,000

Cash IN (Inflows):
- Customer Payments          $45,000
- Loan Received              $5,000
Total Cash In               $50,000

Cash OUT (Outflows):
- Salary/Owner Draw         $20,000
- Supplies                  $12,000
- Rent                       $4,000
- Equipment Purchase         $8,000
- Taxes Paid                 $3,000
Total Cash Out              $47,000

Ending Cash (Jan 31)       $13,000
```

**The Critical Difference**:
- Income Statement: You made $45k profit (accrual basis)
- Cash Flow: You have $13k in bank (cash basis)

Why the difference? Customers might owe you money, but you haven't received it yet. You can be profitable but still run out of cash if you don't collect from customers!

## Key Accounting Concepts

### Accrual vs. Cash Accounting

**Cash Accounting** (what small businesses often start with):
- Record money when it physically arrives
- Simple but incomplete
- "I got paid, so I'm making money"

**Accrual Accounting** (more accurate):
- Record sales when you earn them (even if unpaid)
- Record expenses when incurred (even if not paid yet)
- More accurate picture of profitability
- Required by larger businesses

**Example**:
- Jan 15: You complete a $5,000 project
- Feb 15: Customer pays you

**Cash Method**: $0 income in January, $5k in February
**Accrual Method**: $5k income in January (when earned), recorded as receivable until paid in February

**Rule of Thumb**: If your revenue exceeds $100k/year or you have inventory, use accrual accounting.

### Depreciation

Equipment doesn't stay valuable forever. Accounting recognizes this.

**The Concept**: A $10,000 laptop loses value over time.

**How It Works**:
- Equipment: $10,000 laptop purchased Year 1
- Useful Life: 5 years
- Annual Depreciation: $10,000 ÷ 5 = $2,000/year
- This becomes an expense, reducing your taxes

**Why It Matters**:
- Matches cost to revenue earned using the equipment
- Creates a tax deduction
- Reflects reality (equipment wears out)

**Example Over 3 Years**:
| Year | Equipment Value | Depreciation Expense | Book Value |
|------|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | $10,000 | $2,000 | $8,000 |
| Year 2 | $10,000 | $2,000 | $6,000 |
| Year 3 | $10,000 | $2,000 | $4,000 |

### Accounts Receivable & Payable

**Accounts Receivable** (money customers owe you):
- Invoice a customer on Jan 15
- They pay on Feb 28
- In between, it's "accounts receivable"
- Important: It's income even though you don't have the cash yet
- Risk: Customer doesn't pay

**Accounts Payable** (money you owe suppliers):
- Order supplies on Jan 10, due payment Feb 10
- In between, it's "accounts payable"
- Important: It's an expense even though you haven't paid yet
- Benefit: Free short-term financing

**Managing These**:
- Track who owes you money and when
- Follow up on unpaid invoices
- Track what you owe and due dates
- Build spreadsheet or use software

## Understanding Financial Ratios

These help you understand your business health:

### 1. Profit Margin
**What**: % of revenue you keep as profit
**Formula**: Net Profit ÷ Revenue

**Example**:
- Revenue: $100,000
- Expenses: $70,000
- Profit: $30,000
- Profit Margin: 30%

**Benchmark**:
- Tech startups: 20-50%
- Retail: 5-15%
- Services: 20-40%
- Nonprofits: Break even or reinvest

**Use**: Compare to competitors, track improvement

### 2. Current Ratio
**What**: Can you pay short-term debts?
**Formula**: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities

**Example**:
- Current Assets (cash + receivables): $20,000
- Current Liabilities (due within 1 year): $10,000
- Current Ratio: 2.0
- Meaning: You have $2 in assets for every $1 in short-term debts

**Benchmark**: 1.5 - 3.0 is healthy

### 3. Debt-to-Equity Ratio
**What**: How much debt vs. ownership stake?
**Formula**: Total Debt ÷ Owner's Equity

**Example**:
- Total Debt: $50,000
- Owner's Equity: $100,000
- Debt-to-Equity: 0.5
- Meaning: For every $1 you've invested, you've borrowed $0.50

**Benchmark**: Under 1.0 is conservative, under 2.0 is reasonable

## The Monthly Close Process

Professional businesses close their books monthly. Here's what that means:

### End of Month Checklist
- [ ] Record all transactions through month-end
- [ ] Reconcile bank account
- [ ] Record month-end journal entries (rent, payroll)
- [ ] Review and adjust accounts
- [ ] Generate financial statements
- [ ] Investigate discrepancies
- [ ] Archive receipts and documentation

### Journal Entries

A journal entry records a transaction in accounting language:

**Example**: "I paid $500 for office supplies"

```
Office Supplies Expense     $500
    Cash                           $500
```

This says: "Office supplies went up by $500, cash went down by $500"

**Another Example**: "I earned $5,000 but customer hasn't paid yet"

```
Accounts Receivable         $5,000
    Service Revenue                 $5,000
```

This says: "I have a $5,000 receivable (future cash), and I've earned $5,000 revenue"

## Common Accounting Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Confusing Cash and Profit
**The Problem**: You think you're profitable because cash is in the bank
**The Reality**: Cash might be from a loan, not sales. Or sales haven't been collected yet.
**The Solution**: Monitor both profit AND cash flow

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Recording Expenses You Don't Pay Immediately
**The Problem**: You forgot about the electric bill from last month
**The Reality**: Expenses from your business period belong to that period
**The Solution**: Use accrual accounting, record when incurred not when paid

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not Tracking Accounts Receivable
**The Problem**: You don't know which customers owe you money
**The Reality**: Cash flow problems when you can't collect
**The Solution**: Keep an aging report (who owes what, how old is the debt?)

### ❌ Mistake 4: Ignoring Financial Statements
**The Problem**: "I'll look at numbers next year"
**The Reality**: You don't know if you're actually profitable
**The Solution**: Review monthly statements, spot trends early

## Accounting for Different Business Types

### Freelancer/Consultant
**Focus Areas**:
- Track income by client (who's most profitable?)
- Track time and expenses
- Watch accounts receivable (when will customers pay?)
- Plan quarterly tax payments

**Equation**: Revenue (from clients) - Expenses (software, home office) = Profit

### Retail Store
**Focus Areas**:
- Inventory costing (what did it cost vs. sell price?)
- Product profitability (which items make most profit?)
- Accounts payable (manage supplier payments)
- Sales tax collection

**Equation**: Sales - Cost of Goods Sold - Operating Expenses = Profit

### Service Business (salon, cleaning, etc.)
**Focus Areas**:
- Service profitability by type
- Labor costs as % of revenue
- Recurring vs. one-time clients
- Equipment depreciation

**Equation**: Service Revenue - Labor - Supplies - Overhead = Profit

### E-commerce
**Focus Areas**:
- Cost of goods sold (product cost + shipping)
- Gross margin vs. net profit
- Return/refund impact
- Payment processor fees

**Equation**: Product Sales - Cost of Goods - Platform Fees - Refunds = Profit

## Red Flags in Financial Statements

### 🚩 Red Flag 1: Declining Profit Margins
- Year 1: 40% profit margin
- Year 2: 35%
- Year 3: 28%
**Meaning**: Revenue growing but profit isn't. Something's inefficient.

### 🚩 Red Flag 2: Growing Revenue but Shrinking Cash
- Revenue up 30%
- Cash down 20%
**Meaning**: Customers aren't paying, or you're spending too fast

### 🚩 Red Flag 3: Growing Accounts Receivable
- Month 1: $5,000 owed
- Month 2: $8,000 owed
- Month 3: $12,000 owed
**Meaning**: Customer collection problems ahead

### 🚩 Red Flag 4: Debt Growing Faster Than Equity
- Borrowed $50k more than last year
- Ownership stake only grew $10k
**Meaning**: Getting more leveraged, riskier position
