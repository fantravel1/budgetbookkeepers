## Multi-Country Considerations

### Expand Beyond Home Country

**Strategy**:
1. Start in home country
2. Once profitable, consider:
   - Free zone (Singapore, UAE) for regional HQ
   - Or expand to target market (establish subsidiary)
3. Plan transfer pricing (how to allocate profits across entities)
4. Use tax treaties to minimize double taxation

### Transfer Pricing
- If parent company sells to subsidiary at "transfer price"
- Must use "arm's length" pricing (what unrelated parties would charge)
- IRS/tax authority scrutinizes heavily
- Requires documentation and compliance

### Double Taxation Avoidance
- Most countries have tax treaties
- Can get foreign tax credits
- Plan with professional advice
