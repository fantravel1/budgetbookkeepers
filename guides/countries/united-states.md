## Common Tax Mistakes

- Use IRS ABC test to determine classification

### ❌ Mixing Personal and Business Expenses
- Audit risk
- IRS disallows entire categories sometimes
- Keep business expenses separate

### ❌ Not Tracking Mileage
- Can't deduct vehicle without documentation
- Keep mileage log (date, miles, purpose)
- Standard rate 2024: $0.67/mile

### ❌ Excessive Home Office Deduction
- Triggers audits if disproportionate
- Reasonable: 10-15% of home expense
- Document dedicated use

### ❌ Missing Quarterly Estimated Taxes
- Underpayment penalty if significantly under
- Make quarterly payments or face penalty + interest

## Multi-State Sales Tax

### Sales Tax Nexus
You must collect sales tax in states where you have "nexus":
- Physical location (office, warehouse)
- Employees
- Affiliate (for some states)
- Threshold sales ($100k-1M depending on state after South Dakota v. Wayfair)

### Economic Nexus Thresholds
- TX, NY, CA: Often $100k+ threshold
- Many states: $100k or $500+ transactions
- Some: $0 (must collect immediately)

### Compliance
- Register in each state where you have nexus
- Collect sales tax at point of sale
- File monthly/quarterly/annually (varies by state)
- Pay collected tax to state
